            Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, sparked attention with an unexpected visit to Beijing despite ongoing U.S. restrictions on advanced chip sales to China. During his trip, Huang reportedly met with the founder of Chinese AI company DeepSeek, raising questions about Nvidia's strategy in navigating geopolitical tensions. The visit comes as Nvidia faces strict export controls on its most powerful AI chips to Chinese customers, though the company continues to sell modified versions that comply with U.S. regulations. Nvidia maintains its position as the dominant supplier of AI accelerators globally while carefully balancing U.S. policy constraints and its commercial interests in the Chinese market.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/17/nvidias-ceo-surprise-visit-beijing-restricts-chip-sales-china

The probe was announced just one day before CEO Jensen Huang was scheduled to visit Washington.

The model, which uses binary quantization to dramatically reduce computational requirements, maintains performance comparable to full-precision models while consuming significantly less memory and power. Microsoft published the model weights on Hugging Face alongside open-source code for implementation, making this resource-efficient approach accessible to developers with limited computational resources.<br><br>Source: analyticsindiamag.com https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/microsoft-unveils-1-bit-compact-llm-that-runs-on-cpus/

            The viral trend of using AI to transform selfies into Barbie dolls or action figures carries significant privacy risks for users. These AI image generators typically require users to upload multiple photos, potentially granting companies access to biometric data that could be used for facial recognition or stored indefinitely. Security experts warn that many of these services lack transparency about how they use personal data, with some applications potentially training their AI models on uploaded images without clear consent. Users should carefully review privacy policies before uploading photos to these services and consider using established platforms with clearer data protection practices.<br><br>Source: fox13news.com<br>https://www.fox13news.com/news/what-know-before-using-ai-turn-yourself-barbie-doll-action-figure

            An anonymous user uploaded a modified version of a popular song to a music-sharing platform that sounds identical to humans but successfully evades AI copyright detection systems. The technique demonstrates a significant vulnerability in automated content protection mechanisms that rely on digital fingerprinting. This exploit highlights the growing sophistication of AI-circumvention methods and poses challenges for intellectual property protection in digital media. The case illustrates how subtle modifications can fool algorithmic systems while remaining imperceptible to human listeners.<br><br>Source: moneylife.in<br>https://www.moneylife.in/article/fraud-alert-dark-side-of-ai/76918.html
