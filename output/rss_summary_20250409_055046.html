                        Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former executive at Meta Platforms Inc., plans to tell Congress that the social media company undermined U.S. national security interests while strengthening China&#39;s position in the AI race. Meta has disputed her claims, stating that they are false.

Wynn-Williams, a former director of global public policy at Facebook, is set to testify before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Wednesday. Her testimony is expected to shed light on Meta&#39;s alleged actions that may have benefited China&#39;s AI development at the expense of U.S. interests.

This information is relevant to AI developers and enthusiasts who follow the industry&#39;s geopolitical dynamics. The potential implications of a major tech company&#39;s actions on national security and the global AI landscape are significant and warrant close attention.

                        President Donald Trump signed executive orders on April 8 aimed at reviving the U.S. coal industry. The orders are intended to prop up coal production, in part to fuel the growing demand for energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Trump claimed the orders would end &#34;Joe Biden&#39;s war on beautiful, clean coal.&#34; However, the move clashes with global efforts to reduce coal power and cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

                        The White House has issued an executive order aimed at reviving the U.S. coal industry. The order directs federal agencies to take steps to support and promote the use of clean coal technologies. It also amends a previous executive order to remove restrictions on coal-fired power plants.

This move is expected to benefit AI developers working on technologies related to clean coal and carbon capture. The order provides a policy framework that could drive increased investment and innovation in these areas. However, it is likely to face opposition from environmental groups concerned about the impact on climate change.
