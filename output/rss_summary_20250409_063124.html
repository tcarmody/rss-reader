                        Linus Torvalds created the version control system Git 20 years ago as a replacement for the proprietary BitKeeper tool. In a recent interview, Torvalds discussed the early days of Git, the key design decisions behind its success, and how it has forever changed software development.

Torvalds initially developed Git in just 10 days to meet his own needs for the Linux kernel project. The unconventional and decentralized design of Git, which was revolutionary at the time, has since become ubiquitous and seemingly obvious. Torvalds emphasized that his primary goal was to create a tool that worked well for him, rather than worrying about broader appeal.

The interview covers Torvalds&#39; thought process in designing Git&#39;s core concepts, such as the use of SHA-1 hashes for stability and the distributed nature that has enabled services like GitHub to thrive. While Torvalds had a clear vision from the start, he was not certain the project would be as successful as it has become over the past 20 years.

Torvalds also discussed his decision to hand off maintainership of Git to Junio Hamano early on, and how he has largely stepped back from active involvement in the project since then, as it has evolved to meet the needs of a much broader community of users. He noted that while he is not closely following the latest developments, he is generally satisfied with the direction the project has taken.

Overall, the interview provides insights into the origins and design philosophy of one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, from the perspective of its creator.

                        Trump Signs Orders to Revive Coal-Fired Power Plants

The U.S. president signed four executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry, which has been in decline. The orders are intended to address the rising power demand for datacenters, AI, and electric vehicles, but environmentalists have criticized the move as a step backward in addressing climate change.

The orders will allow coal-fired power plants to remain open, despite their substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Environmentalists have expressed dismay, arguing that Trump is stuck in the past and wants utility customers to &#34;pay more for yesterday&#39;s energy.&#34;

This information is relevant to AI developers and others who follow the AI industry, as the increased power demand from AI systems is cited as one of the reasons for the executive orders. The move highlights the ongoing tension between economic and environmental concerns in the energy sector.

                        At Inception, we have been working to enhance AI model evaluations within the Arabic language context. Previously, we introduced AraGen, one of the first generative Arabic leaderboards, serving as a benchmark for evaluating Arabic LLMs on generative tasks. As part of our ongoing efforts, we are excited to share the following updates.

The Arabic-Leaderboards is a comprehensive and unified space for all Arabic evaluations and tasks, serving as a central hub covering a broad spectrum of evaluations for models across modalities. Currently, it has AraGen-03-25 and Arabic Instruction Following as live leaderboards, with plans to expand with more leaderboards and tasks for Arabic AI models.

The AraGen Benchmark, introduced in December 2024, features a dynamic nature with private evaluation datasets for three months to ensure fair and unbiased assessments. The latest AraGen-12-24 release expands the dataset to 340 pairs of questions and answers, reflecting a focus on question answering as the main use case for language models, chatbots, and AI assistants.

The newly introduced Arabic Instruction Following (Arabic IFEval) dataset adapts the English IFEval benchmark to the Arabic language, providing a standardized, objective way to measure a model&#39;s instruction adherence. The dataset consists of approximately 300 prompts covering various types of verifiable instructions, with rigorous expert validation to ensure grammatical accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and clarity.

This work on Arabic benchmarks is crucial for driving improvements in Arabic AI models and enabling fair comparisons across different systems, ultimately benefiting the broader Arabic-speaking community.

                        Dow Chemical and X-energy have applied for a construction permit with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a chemical plant in Texas that will be powered by four of X-energy&#39;s Xe-100 nuclear reactors. The plant will produce plastics and other materials, and the nuclear reactors will provide steam and electricity to power the facility.

This project represents a significant milestone for advanced nuclear technology, as it demonstrates the potential for nuclear power to be integrated directly with industrial operations. The high-temperature gas-cooled reactors designed by X-energy can deliver the consistent, high-temperature steam required by the chemical plant.

The progress with the regulatory approval process is positive news for the companies involved and the broader advanced nuclear industry. If successful, this project could serve as a model for how new nuclear energy technologies can be used to decarbonize power-hungry industrial processes, including data centers.

It will take up to two and a half years for the NRC to review the construction permit application, and the site will also need to receive an operating license before the nuclear reactors can begin operations, which are expected to start in the early next decade.

                        The U.S. president&#39;s sweeping tariffs have sent global stock markets tumbling, setting the stage for a potential trade war and economic recession. Experts warn that the U.S. cleantech sector is particularly vulnerable, as the tariffs and economic uncertainty could undermine progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and the nation&#39;s leadership in this growing industry.

The impact of the economic shifts could be wide-ranging, depending on factors like the ongoing budget negotiations in Congress. These will determine the fate of subsidies for electric vehicles, battery production, and other clean technologies established by the Inflation Reduction Act. A slowdown in the broader economy also threatens to tighten corporate and venture capital funding for startups working on carbon removal, synthetic aviation fuels, and other climate tech.

This information is crucial for AI developers and others following the cleantech and climate tech sectors, as it highlights the potential challenges and risks they may face due to the economic uncertainty and policy changes. The long-term concern is that if government support for cleantech advances and retreats with each administration, companies may be less willing to make the long-term investments needed to drive progress in these critical industries.

                        Russia&#39;s AI Capabilities Lag Behind Major Economies

A Russian intelligence officer who defected has revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not use the internet or have a smartphone. This, along with global sanctions, has prevented Russia from developing a domestic AI sector. Russia is ranked 31st in the world in AI capacity, behind every major economy and even small countries. The country has lost about 10% of its tech workforce to emigration since 2022, further compounding the problem.

Russia&#39;s lack of access to advanced semiconductors and chips required for AI development could have significant implications for its military capabilities. The war in Ukraine has highlighted Russia&#39;s technological disadvantage, and the capabilities gap between European and Russian militaries could grow further if the conflict remains frozen for a few years. This presents an opportunity for Russia&#39;s rivals to employ a deterrence-by-denial strategy by depriving Russia of access to the advanced chips needed for AI.

The article suggests that encouraging further emigration of AI-literate graduates from Russia to the West, as well as communicating Russia&#39;s AI trajectory to anti-Putin individuals within the regime, could potentially destabilize the country. However, the long-term impact of Russia&#39;s AI shortcomings on its strategic position remains uncertain, as the deterrence landscape may change rapidly in the coming years.

                        Tech giants see 22% drop since Trump&#39;s inauguration

Several major tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have seen their stock prices drop by 22% since former President Trump&#39;s inauguration in January 2020. This comes despite the CEOs of these firms spending significant sums to curry favor with the Trump administration through donations to the inauguration and visits to Mar-a-Lago. The disappointing returns suggest that the tech leaders&#39; investment in lobbying the former president has not paid off as expected. This information is relevant to AI developers and others who follow the tech industry, as it highlights the challenges companies can face when trying to influence political leaders.

                        The booming investment in artificial intelligence is overwhelming suppliers of giant metal turbines used to turn natural gas into electricity, leading to longer wait times and higher costs for building new gas power plants.

Companies that haven&#39;t already reserved this specialized equipment, which can weigh as much as a large airplane and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are facing waits of three to four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier. The cost of building gas power plants has also soared, with some estimates showing it now costs two to three times as much as it did a few years ago.

This challenge in securing enough gas turbines is a clear example of how the rising demand for AI, driven by the need for data centers to train and use chatbots and other AI applications, is reshaping the electric power industry. It also serves as a reminder of the gap between the plans and goals of politicians, energy executives, and the reality on the ground.

                        Researchers have developed a framework to assess how advanced AI models could be misused to enable or enhance cyberattacks. The framework covers the entire cyberattack chain, addresses a wide range of threat types, and is grounded in real-world data. It enables cybersecurity experts to identify necessary defenses and prioritize them before malicious actors can exploit AI for sophisticated cyberattacks.

The framework recognizes that advanced AI models could automate and accelerate cyberattacks, potentially lowering costs for attackers and raising the risks of attacks being carried out at greater scale. It adapts established cybersecurity evaluation frameworks to account for how AI could make attacks faster, cheaper, or easier.

The researchers analyzed over 12,000 real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks across 20 countries, identifying common patterns and critical bottleneck stages along the cyberattack chain where AI could significantly disrupt the traditional costs of an attack. This information helps defenders prioritize their security resources more effectively.

The framework also includes an offensive cyber capability benchmark to comprehensively assess the cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses of frontier AI models. This benchmark aims to provide defenders with the ability to develop targeted mitigations and simulate AI-powered attacks as part of red teaming exercises.

                        President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at boosting coal&#39;s flagging fortunes. The order will direct the federal government to list coal as a critical mineral and force some coal-fired power plants that had faced closure to keep generating electricity. While the executive order might forestall some closures, it&#39;s unlikely to reverse coal&#39;s persistent decline in the power sector.

Coal&#39;s share of electricity generation has declined steadily since 2001, and today it accounts for only about 15% of the country&#39;s electricity. Clean air regulations and the rise of low-cost natural gas and renewable energy sources have been the primary drivers of coal&#39;s decline. The Trump administration&#39;s efforts to prop up the coal industry are unlikely to have a significant impact on the power sector&#39;s shift away from coal.

                        Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company, plans to use data from its robotaxis, including video from interior cameras tied to rider identities, to train generative AI models. This revelation comes from an unreleased version of Waymo&#39;s privacy policy, discovered by researcher Jane Manchun Wong.

The move raises concerns about how much of a rider&#39;s behavior inside Waymo&#39;s autonomous vehicles could be repurposed for other purposes, such as targeted advertising. AI developers should be aware of the potential privacy implications and the need for transparent data-handling practices.

This information is significant for those following the AI industry, as it highlights the growing use of personal data, even from seemingly private settings like autonomous vehicles, to train advanced AI models. The development underscores the importance of robust data privacy regulations and consumer awareness around the use of their personal information.

                        Amazon Tests Agent-Based Shopping Feature

Amazon has quietly announced that it is testing a new shopping feature that utilizes an AI agent. This agent-based shopping feature could potentially undercut other shopping apps in the future. The growing availability of AI agents, which can perform tasks like ordering a pizza or booking a flight on behalf of consumers, threatens to diminish the role of apps over time, making them easier to replace. While some companies, like DoorDash, have raised concerns about this issue, Amazon&#39;s move to develop its own agent-based shopping feature is a strategic attempt to get ahead of the threat. This information is relevant to AI developers who are interested in the potential impact of AI agents on the app-based economy.

                        Precursor Ventures, a nine-year-old venture capital firm, has raised $66 million for its fifth fund. This is 20% less than the firm&#39;s previous fund raised in 2021, reflecting the challenging fundraising environment for venture capital firms.

With limited options for startup exits through acquisitions or IPOs, Precursor Ventures plans to rely more on selling stock of private startups to other investors to return cash to its limited partners. This strategy is expected to account for 75% to 80% of the dollars returned to investors over the next five years.

                        Microsoft has started testing a new update to its Copilot app on Windows that will allow users to share their screen or apps with the AI assistant. Copilot Vision, which was previously limited to Microsoft&#39;s Edge browser, is now extending to any app on the user&#39;s PC. The AI assistant can now coach users through the use of Adobe Photoshop features or analyze the photos and webpages they&#39;re viewing.

The new Copilot Vision feature is currently being tested with U.S. Windows Insiders, and it will be able to highlight parts of the user&#39;s screen to guide them through apps, although this functionality is not yet enabled in the initial beta version. Microsoft has also started testing file search in Copilot on Windows, allowing users to ask the AI assistant about the contents of various file types on their PC.

These new Copilot features are part of Microsoft&#39;s efforts to expand the capabilities of its AI assistant and make it more useful for Windows 11 users. As the company continues to refine and improve Copilot, it will be interesting to see how the AI assistant&#39;s integration with Windows evolves and how it can enhance the user experience.

                        President Trump has implemented higher tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, the EU, and Vietnam. The tariffs are meant to be &#34;reciprocal&#34; but exceed conventional calculations. The tariffs have already impacted various industries, with companies like Nintendo, Jaguar Land Rover, and Micron announcing delays or surcharges on their products.

This information is relevant to AI developers as the higher tariffs could affect the cost and availability of components and consumer electronics, which are crucial for AI hardware and software development. The tariffs also highlight the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, which could have broader implications for the technology industry.

                        Meta is developing a version of Instagram for iPad, according to The Information. Currently, running Instagram on an iPad is just a blown-up version of the iPhone app, so an official Instagram app from Meta would be a welcome change. The uncertain legal status of TikTok amid the divest-or-ban law and Trump&#39;s tariffs might be the push required for Meta to prioritize an iPad app. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri has previously stated that it&#39;s not a big enough group of people to be a priority, but the company may now see it as an important move to compete with TikTok&#39;s growing presence on tablets.

                        Kevin Bates, the creator of the Arduboy game-playing business card, is being forced to shut down his company due to the new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite over $1 million in lifetime Arduboy sales, the 104% tariff on products from China will make it impossible for Bates to continue operating his business profitably.

Bates says that even if he wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S., there are no manufacturers who would be able to produce the Arduboy at a reasonable cost. The global trade that allowed the Arduboy to exist is now being disrupted by the trade war, and Bates is already looking for a new day job.

This news is significant for AI developers and enthusiasts who have followed the Arduboy&#39;s journey. The Arduboy was a unique product that allowed individuals to create and distribute their own games and applications, and its demise is a cautionary tale about the impact of trade policies on small businesses and innovative products.

                        Amazon tweaks its Amazon Haul service, adding products from well-known brands like Adidas and Levi&#39;s that are shipped from U.S. warehouses. This is a shift from Haul&#39;s initial focus on very cheap, unbranded products directly from Chinese manufacturers. The change is likely connected to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which will tax all imports coming into the U.S. Amazon&#39;s move to stock Haul with inventory already in the U.S. avoids these new tariffs, at least temporarily. However, in a few weeks, shoppers&#39; &#34;hauls&#34; of cheap items may become less affordable as the tariffs take effect.

                        Hulu has shared a new trailer for the upcoming animated anthology film Predator: Killer of Killers, which will tell the stories of human warriors fighting for their lives against the Yautja race of alien hunters across different time periods.

The film will feature three separate encounters, with the Predators setting their sights on a Viking raider, samurai from feudal Japan, and a WWII Allied pilot. While the human fighters are skilled, they are no match for the Predators&#39; advanced weaponry.

Killer of Killers is set in the same larger universe as the recent Predator film Prey and the upcoming live-action feature Predator: Badlands, but it is designed to work as a standalone project.

                        Figure AI, a prominent humanoid robot startup, has been accused of overstating the deployment of its robots at BMW. The company, which has raised over $700 million to date, claimed in interviews and videos that it had deployed humanoids at BMW&#39;s facilities. However, an investigation found that the actual deployment was more limited than Figure AI had suggested. This raises concerns about the accuracy of the startup&#39;s claims and the transparency it provides to AI developers and industry observers.
