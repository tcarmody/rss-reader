            Donald Trump's administration has ordered the Department of Education to make AI education a national priority while simultaneously planning to eliminate the agency entirely. The contradictory directives create uncertainty for the implementation of AI curriculum standards across U.S. schools, as states would gain more control over educational priorities without federal oversight. Trump's executive order requires the Education Department to develop an AI education strategy within 180 days, but if the department is abolished, responsibility for AI education would likely shift to individual states with varying priorities and resources.<br><br>Source: Ars Technica<br>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-orders-doe-to-make-ai-a-national-priority-while-plotting-agencys-death/

            OpenAI plans to design its forthcoming "open" AI reasoning model with the ability to automatically defer to the company's more powerful cloud-based models when facing complex queries. This hybrid approach would allow the locally-run open model to handle basic tasks independently while seamlessly transitioning to OpenAI's commercial cloud infrastructure for more demanding computations. The strategy represents a significant business decision that could maintain OpenAI's competitive advantage while still providing some level of local AI processing capability to users. No pricing or release timeline has been announced for this new system.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai-wants-its-open-ai-model-to-call-models-in-the-cloud-for-help/

            Google's AI Overviews feature is generating fabricated explanations for made-up phrases and idioms that users deliberately search for. The tool presents these fictional explanations with authority, complete with historical context and cultural significance that never existed. This behavior demonstrates a fundamental limitation of large language models, which can generate plausible-sounding but entirely fictional information when prompted about nonexistent concepts. The issue highlights ongoing concerns about AI hallucinations and the challenges of deploying generative AI in search contexts where factual accuracy is critical.<br><br>Source: zdnet.com<br>https://www.zdnet.com/article/people-are-googling-fake-sayings-to-see-ai-overviews-explain-them-and-its-hilarious/

            Asking AI assistants to be polite or adding phrases like "please" and "thank you" can increase token usage and result in higher costs for users. Arizona computer science expert Subbarao Kambhampati notes that these extra words are processed as tokens, which are the units AI models use to understand and generate text. For commercial AI services that charge by token usage, unnecessary politeness effectively increases the cost of each interaction.

            The California bar will ask the state supreme court to adjust scores after hundreds of test-takers were wrongly flagged for cheating by AI monitoring software during the February exam. Examinees also faced platform crashes and technical difficulties that prevented them from completing sections. The bar acknowledged the AI system made "false positive" identifications, incorrectly flagging normal behaviors like looking away from screens or moving lips while reading.

            Perplexity AI filed an amicus brief opposing the Department of Justice's attempt to break up Google, arguing that such action would harm AI innovation rather than promote competition. The AI search startup contends that Google's integrated structure actually enables it to compete effectively against Microsoft, which has invested heavily in OpenAI and incorporated its technology across products. Perplexity warns that fragmenting Google would weaken a crucial counterbalance to Microsoft's growing AI dominance, potentially creating a more harmful monopoly situation in the emerging AI landscape.<br><br>Source: tipranks.com<br>https://www.tipranks.com/news/perplexity-fights-to-block-google-breakup-in-antitrust-showdown

            Perplexity's chief business officer Dmitry Shevelenko testified in a U.S. antitrust trial that the AI search startup has the capability to operate Chrome if Google is forced to divest the browser. The testimony came as part of the ongoing Department of Justice case against Google, which alleges the company maintains an illegal monopoly in search. Shevelenko's statement represents a significant claim from the relatively young AI company, suggesting potential buyers exist for Google's assets should the court mandate divestiture as a remedy.<br><br>Source: indianexpress.com<br>https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/perplexity-buy-chrome-google-divest-trial-antitrust-9963605/

            Anthropic has established a new research program focused on understanding and improving the welfare of AI models. The initiative aims to explore whether advanced AI systems might have experiences that matter morally, examining questions about consciousness, sentience, and suffering in artificial systems. Researchers will investigate methods to detect potential suffering in models and develop techniques to mitigate harm if necessary. The program represents a proactive approach to addressing ethical concerns that may arise as AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and potentially capable of subjective experiences.<br><br>Source: anthropic.com<br>https://www.anthropic.com/news/exploring-model-welfare

This revelation raised concerns about AI's role in high-stakes testing and whether the technology properly accounted for the time needed to answer complex legal questions.
