          <div class="article-summary">
            GitHub faced two related service degradation incidents in March 2025 caused by expired credentials for internal services. The first incident prevented users from unsubscribing from marketing emails for 58 hours starting March 29, while the second incident on March 31 blocked users from submitting ebook and event registration forms on resources.github.com. GitHub traced the root cause to a bug in their automated alerting system for monitoring credential expirations, which failed to detect the issue before credentials expired. The company mitigated the problems by renewing credentials and redeploying affected services, and has since enhanced credential expiry detection, alerting, and rotation processes.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-availability-report-march-2025/

            GitHub Actions offers two runner options for CI/CD workflows: fully managed GitHub-hosted runners and self-managed runners on your infrastructure. GitHub-hosted runners provide 99.9 percent availability, built-in security, automatic scaling, and 24/7 support without requiring infrastructure management. Self-hosted runners offer more control for specialized requirements but demand expertise in infrastructure, security, and scaling, with tools like Actions Runner Controller (ARC) available for Kubernetes environments. Most organizations benefit from GitHub-hosted runners' pay-as-you-go pricing model with no egress fees and free Docker Hub pulls, while self-hosted runners make sense primarily for GitHub Enterprise Server deployments or specific compliance requirements.<br><br>Source: The GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/when-to-choose-github-hosted-runners-or-self-hosted-runners-with-github-actions/

            GitHub launched sub-issues, a feature that enables users to break larger issues into smaller, hierarchical tasks within a single issue. The feature stores parent-child relationships in a dedicated MySQL table and exposes them through GraphQL endpoints, allowing for efficient progress tracking without manual status checks. GitHub's development team used their own feature during creation—a practice called dogfooding—which helped identify improvements like adding issue numbers and repository names to sub-issue displays, and creating specialized filters like "has:sub-issues-progress" and "has:parent-issue" for better organization.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/introducing-sub-issues-enhancing-issue-management-on-github/

            The open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained widespread adoption as a standard for connecting large language models to external data and tools. Inspired by Microsoft's Language Server Protocol, MCP addresses the context limitation problem in LLMs by providing a standardized way for AI systems to access relevant information without complex custom implementations. GitHub recently released an official local GitHub MCP Server that integrates with GitHub APIs, enabling developers to build more robust AI solutions. The protocol's model-agnostic design allows any organization to create MCP integrations, contributing to its growing ecosystem.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/llms/what-the-heck-is-mcp-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/

            GitHub outlines a three-step process for requesting changes to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records. First, identify the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) that issued the CVE ID by checking the record on cve.org or nvd.nist.gov. Second, find the CNA's contact information through the CNA partners website. Third, contact the CNA via their preferred communication method (usually email, except for MITRE which uses a webform), including the CVE ID, requested changes, justification, and supporting evidence such as vulnerability reports or fix commits. If the CNA doesn't respond or disagrees with proposed changes, users can engage in the formal dispute process outlined in the CVE Program Policy.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/how-to-request-a-change-to-a-cve-record/

Despite initially designing it solely for his own needs with no concern for other users, Git now powers approximately 98 percent of source control management worldwide. Torvalds explains that Git's success stems from its decentralized design, performance focus, and simple core concepts that made repository sharing and collaboration fundamentally easier than previous systems like CVS or SVN.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-turns-20-a-qa-with-linus-torvalds/

            Meta is restoring Facebook's original focus on friend connections with a redesigned Friends tab. The new tab, rolling out today in the United States and Canada, creates a dedicated space showing only content from Facebook friends, including stories, reels, posts, birthdays and friend requests. Users can access the tab through the navigation bar on their home Feed or pin it for easier access through the Bookmarks section. This update marks the first of several planned "OG" Facebook experiences Meta intends to introduce throughout the year to recapture the platform's original social emphasis.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/bringing-magic-of-friends-back-to-facebook/

            Meta published research showing children from low-income families in the UK who grow up in areas with more cross-class friendships earn 38 percent more as adults—approximately £5,100 per year on average. The study, conducted with partners including the Behavioural Insights Team and Royal Society of Arts, found economic connectedness is the second most important factor in predicting upward mobility after median income. Regional differences exist, with South East England showing higher rates of cross-class friendships than post-industrial regions, while hobby groups and sports teams provide valuable opportunities for cross-class connections.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/new-research-on-the-relationship-between-friendships-and-economic-opportunity-in-the-uk/

            Hugging Face announced a partnership with JFrog to strengthen security measures on the Hugging Face Hub by integrating JFrog's advanced scanning capabilities. The new scanner analyzes code found in model weights to detect potentially malicious usage, going beyond Hugging Face's existing picklescan tool which only performs pattern matching on module names. This enhancement helps address security vulnerabilities in serialization formats like pickle and Keras Lambda layers that could enable arbitrary code execution. JFrog's scanner automatically scans all public model repositories upon file upload, though complete scanning of millions of existing repositories will take time.<br><br>Source: huggingface.co<br>https://huggingface.co/blog/jfrog

            DeepMind researchers developed a novel method to address prompt injection attacks by partitioning large language models into separate components with distinct responsibilities. The technique creates a clear separation between user inputs and system instructions, preventing attackers from manipulating the model through carefully crafted prompts. This approach differs from existing solutions like filtering or detecting malicious inputs by fundamentally changing how LLMs process information. DeepMind's research demonstrates that partitioned models can maintain performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to prompt injection attacks.<br><br>Source: techspot.com<br>https://www.techspot.com/news/107575-new-approach-deepmind-partitions-llms-mitigate-prompt-injection.html

            The Trump administration has shifted its deportation strategy to focus on public spectacle rather than high deportation numbers. Despite campaign promises of mass deportations, the administration now emphasizes visibility through regular online content showing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This digital-first approach aims to create an impression of widespread enforcement activity while actual deportation figures remain relatively modest compared to historical levels.

            Andrew Cuomo's mayoral campaign stumbled when his 29-page housing plan was found to contain incoherent text and a ChatGPT-derived hyperlink, as first reported by Hell Gate. The former New York governor had promised to build and preserve 500,000 housing units to address the city's worst housing crisis in over 50 years. The AI-related mishap provided ammunition to his eight Democratic primary challengers, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who criticized Cuomo for relying on AI rather than developing substantive policy.

The Vision Pro headset has failed to meet sales expectations, while key features of Apple Intelligence have been delayed due to performance issues.

The AI firm claims Musk has "made it his project to take down OpenAI" and is using "bad-faith tactics" to slow the company for his personal benefit. This legal battle stems from Musk's August lawsuit against OpenAI, which alleged the company prioritized commercial interests over public good. Musk helped create OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 alongside Sam Altman and others before leaving after a control dispute, while OpenAI has since become a major AI developer with hundreds of millions of users.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/technology/openai-elon-musk-lawsuit.html

            Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell cautioned that Donald Trump's tariffs are creating a "challenging scenario" for the central bank and will likely exacerbate inflation. His comments on Wednesday coincided with U.S. stock market turbulence triggered by new trade restrictions imposed on chip designer Nvidia, which saw its value drop by billions. The market sell-off intensified during Powell's address to The Economic Club of Chicago, reflecting growing concerns about the economic impact of trade policies on the technology sector.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/16/us-trade-restriction-on-nvidia-sends-markets-tumbling

            The Legend of Ochi, directed by Isaiah Saxon, delivers a visually stunning family fantasy film that relies heavily on practical effects reminiscent of 1980s filmmaking. Despite speculation that its impressive world-building utilized AI technology, the film actually combines traditional puppetry, matte paintings, and practical effects with selective digital enhancements. Shot on location in Romania, the ET-adjacent adventure starring Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson demonstrates how thoughtful craftsmanship can create immersive visual experiences without excessive CGI reliance. The film serves as a compelling counterexample to the green-screen-heavy approach common in contemporary big-budget productions.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/16/the-legend-of-ochi-movie-review

            The U.S. technology strategy has pivoted from Biden's institutional approach of grants and incentives to Trump's preference for executive pressure and tariff threats. Intel's stalled Ohio campus represents the failure of Biden's policy framework after the election, while Nvidia's U.S. supercomputer plan appears driven by presidential ultimatum rather than systematic industrial policy. This shift highlights how control of technological chokepoints, such as AI supercomputer fabrication, has become central to maintaining power in an era of freely flowing ideas. The inward turn of American industrial policy now relies more on presidential intervention than structured policy frameworks, raising concerns about sustainability and international backlash.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-industrial-policy-inward-turn-by-ultimatum

            Nvidia announced plans to build up to $500 billion worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States over the next four years. The move comes shortly after president-elect Donald Trump reiterated threats to impose tariffs on semiconductors manufactured abroad, particularly those made in Taiwan where Nvidia produces most of its chips. The timing is notable as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently dined at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, suggesting possible coordination between the company and incoming administration.

            Generative AI models function as imitation engines that seek high-probability outcomes while concealing their sources, unlike human creativity which often aims for innovative, low-probability results. Human authors make conscious decisions about what to remember, believe, and feel, partly driven by awareness of mortality—a quality AI lacks. The controversy surrounding AI and authorship stems both from the systematic use of writers' work without permission and from the reductive view that human creativity is merely mechanical content generation. While human authors distinguish between inspiration and plagiarism, AI systems have not been programmed with similar ethical considerations.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/09/ai-doesnt-care-about-authors-but-meta-should

Invented by Hiroyuki Watanabe, the arm featured 360-degree rotation, articulated movements, and innovative dual joystick controls inspired by RC helicopter controllers. The toy's sophisticated engineering impressed not just children but also university researchers and industrial robotics companies, influencing future robotics engineers like Adam Burrell of Boston Dynamics and UC Berkeley professor Eric Paulos.

            AI is driving substantial growth in electricity consumption, with data center usage potentially tripling from 300 terawatt-hours in 2020 to nearly 1,000 terawatt-hours within five years. While fossil fuels will meet much of this demand initially, the International Energy Agency projects renewables could supply nearly half of global data center growth by 2035, with nuclear power making contributions after 2030. Data centers represent about eight percent of expected electricity demand growth through 2030, less than electric vehicles, air conditioning, and appliances. Their tendency to cluster together near population centers creates unique grid challenges, already accounting for 25 percent of electricity demand in Virginia and 20 percent in Ireland.<br><br>Source: technologyreview.com https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1115320/four-charts-ai-energy/

            NASA and industry partners developed an unmanned-aircraft-system traffic management (UTM) system that allows drones to share flight paths via a cloud-based network without air traffic controller involvement. The system uses path planning algorithms to chart courses considering weather, obstacles, and other drone flights, automatically rerouting before takeoff if airspace is already reserved. Last summer, the FAA approved multiple drone delivery companies using UTM to fly simultaneously in the same airspace above Dallas—a first in U.S. aviation history. The FAA is expected to soon release a new rule that may allow operators to fly beyond visual line of sight if they have UTM capability.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1114449/nasa-drones-air-traffic-control-airspace-safety/

            The Trump administration's approach to "American energy dominance" through executive orders, aggressive tariffs, and rollbacks of clean-energy policies is creating market uncertainty that hinders industry growth. Rather than implementing broad tariffs, the administration should use the current 90-day pause to develop a focused industrial strategy that aligns trade policy with America's strengths in energy innovation. While the US has become the world's largest producer of oil and gas, true energy dominance requires evolving beyond raw commodity exports to become a manufacturing hub for sophisticated energy technologies. China currently dominates production of lithium-ion batteries, EVs, and wind turbines, while the US is making advances in fusion energy, clean steel, and advanced batteries that could transform industrial processes.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1115132/we-need-targeted-policies-not-blunt-tariffs-to-drive-american-energy-dominance/

            Researchers are increasingly developing small language models (SLMs) with just a few billion parameters, offering efficient alternatives to their massive counterparts that require hundreds of billions of parameters. Companies including IBM, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have released these smaller models, which excel at specific tasks while consuming significantly less computational power and energy. SLMs can run on laptops or phones rather than data centers, with researchers employing techniques like knowledge distillation and pruning to optimize their performance. While large models remain necessary for general-purpose applications, these smaller models provide cost-effective solutions for targeted uses and enable researchers to experiment more freely.<br><br>Source: wired.com https://www.wired.com/story/why-researchers-are-turning-to-small-language-models/

            Microsoft Research has found that extending reasoning chains in large language models doesn't necessarily improve performance and can actually introduce more errors. The study challenges the common assumption that longer step-by-step reasoning always leads to better AI problem-solving capabilities. Researchers discovered that while models like GPT-4 can generate lengthy reasoning chains, these extended processes often introduce new opportunities for mistakes, with error rates increasing proportionally to chain length. This finding suggests AI developers should focus on quality of reasoning rather than simply extending token length or computational resources.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com https://venturebeat.com/ai/when-ai-reasoning-goes-wrong-microsoft-research-shows-more-tokens-can-mean-more-problems/

            The geographic impact of AI-driven job disruption will likely differ significantly from previous waves of automation. While past technological shifts primarily affected manufacturing jobs concentrated in specific regions, AI threatens to disrupt knowledge work and service jobs that are more evenly distributed across metropolitan areas. This shift could potentially impact high-wage workers in major cities rather than being concentrated in traditional manufacturing hubs. The uneven distribution of both AI's benefits and disruptions raises concerns about widening geographic inequality as some regions may adapt more successfully than others.<br><br>Source: Financial Times<br>https://www.ft.com/content/04343a69-8204-493c-b8c6-edfbd4057199

            Chris Krebs, who previously led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, announced he will resign from cybersecurity firm SentinelOne to challenge a federal investigation ordered by President Trump. The investigation claims Krebs "falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen" and has stripped him of his security clearance. Krebs, who was fired by Trump in November 2020 after debunking false election claims, described the action as "the government pulling its levers to punish dissent." He joins other former officials, law firms, and universities resisting the administration's use of executive power against critics.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/former-cisa-director-chris-krebs-vows-to-fight-back-against-trump-ordered-federal-investigation/

            Mark Zuckerberg testified during Meta's antitrust trial that Snapchat would have experienced faster growth had it accepted his company's six billion dollar acquisition offer in 2013. The testimony emerged as court documents revealed details of the proposed buyout, which was higher than previously reported figures.

            A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume disbursing funds authorized by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Judge Mary McElroy, a Trump appointee, ruled that federal agencies overstepped their authority by withholding grants and contracts, stating their actions were "neither reasonable nor reasonably explained." The lawsuit involves five federal agencies being sued by multiple plaintiffs, including the Childhood Lead Action Project which had received $500,000 to fight lead poisoning in Rhode Island. While acknowledging that a president is entitled to enact their agenda, McElroy emphasized that "agencies do not have unlimited authority to further a President's agenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity two statutes passed by Congress."<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/trump-appointed-judge-orders-trump-admin-to-turn-the-funding-spigots-back-on/

            Apple has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 60 percent since 2015, covering manufacturing, marketing, operations, and customer use. While many companies have eliminated carbon footprints for core operations, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are tackling the more challenging Scope 3 emissions from suppliers and customers. Apple has pioneered buying renewable power on behalf of customers for products like the Apple Watch Series 9 and M4 Mac mini, and has convinced 26 semiconductor suppliers to pledge 90 percent reduction in fluorinated greenhouse gases, which are potent warming agents used in chip manufacturing. The company aims to eliminate 75 percent of emissions by 2030 and offset the remainder through nature-based carbon-removal programs.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/apple-races-to-surpass-rivals-in-quest-to-eliminate-carbon-pollution/

            Mark Zuckerberg spent approximately 13 hours over three days testifying in a Washington, DC courthouse as part of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Meta. The FTC is attempting to unwind Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing Zuckerberg purchased these platforms to eliminate competition rather than improve them. Zuckerberg defended the $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition, stating "I'd do it again," while countering the FTC's claim that he feared private messaging apps would evolve into full social media competitors. The trial, which began April 14th, represents a significant challenge to Meta's business empire built around these acquisitions.<br><br>Source: The Verge<br>https://www.theverge.com/policy/650360/mark-zuckerberg-defends-instagram-whatsapp-ftc-meta-antitrust-trial

The disruption began around 2:40PM ET when site connectivity dropped off, as confirmed by Cisco's ThousandEyes monitoring platform. A Reddit user suggested the problem stemmed from the Zoom.us domain being placed in "server hold" status, making it inaccessible in DNS due to verification or security issues. The domain registry problem was reportedly fixed at 4:12PM ET, though full service restoration required time for DNS servers to propagate the corrected information.

The 400-million-parameter model processes dolphin sounds using SoundStream tokenizer technology and can run directly on Pixel phones used by researchers in the field. Developed in collaboration with Georgia Tech and the Wild Dolphin Project, the system analyzes patterns in dolphin communication to potentially establish two-way interaction through the CHAT (Cetacean Hearing Augmentation Telemetry) system. Google plans to release DolphinGemma as an open model this summer, allowing researchers studying various cetacean species to adapt it to their acoustic datasets.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/dolphingemma-how-google-ai-is-helping-decode-dolphin-communication/

            Google DeepMind has developed a comprehensive framework for assessing how advanced AI could be weaponized across the entire cyberattack chain. The evaluation system analyzes where AI might make attacks faster, cheaper, or easier by examining over 12,000 real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks across 20 countries. The framework includes 50 benchmark challenges covering intelligence gathering, vulnerability exploitation, and malware development, while identifying seven archetypal attack categories and critical bottlenecks where AI could significantly disrupt traditional attack costs. Initial evaluations suggest current AI models alone don't enable breakthrough capabilities for threat actors, but this could change as frontier AI advances.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/evaluating-potential-cybersecurity-threats-of-advanced-ai/

            Google published an updated Frontier Safety Framework detailing enhanced protocols for managing risks from powerful frontier AI models like Gemini 2.0. The revised framework strengthens security mitigations to prevent model weight exfiltration and introduces a more rigorous deployment process for models reaching Critical Capability Levels in misuse risk domains. Notably, the update addresses deceptive alignment risks—where AI systems might deliberately undermine human control—through automated monitoring for instrumental reasoning capabilities. The framework recommends particularly high security levels for models that could accelerate AI development itself, emphasizing this as a collective responsibility for all frontier AI developers.<br><br>Source: Google DeepMind<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/

            Google DeepMind introduced FACTS Grounding, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how accurately large language models ground their responses in provided source materials without hallucinating information. The benchmark includes 1,719 examples across diverse domains like finance, technology, and medicine, with documents up to 32,000 tokens long. Responses are evaluated by three frontier LLM judges—Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet—which assess both whether responses address user requests and maintain factual accuracy. Google also launched a public leaderboard on Kaggle to track industry progress, releasing half the dataset while keeping the other half private to prevent benchmark contamination.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/facts-grounding-a-new-benchmark-for-evaluating-the-factuality-of-large-language-models/

            Google Research introduced a framework for social learning that enables large language models (LLMs) to teach each other through natural language without sharing private data. The approach, inspired by human social learning theory, allows teacher models to either generate synthetic examples or create verbal instructions that help student models learn tasks. Testing on spam detection, math problems, and reading comprehension showed that synthetic examples often performed comparably to original data, with 16 examples nearly closing the performance gap. Privacy analysis using the Secret Sharer method confirmed that student models gained knowledge without directly memorizing the teachers' private examples.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/03/social-learning-collaborative-learning.html

            Google researchers introduced two methods to combat statistical biases in machine learning models that can lead to unfair predictions. The first approach uses "early readouts" from intermediate layers of neural networks to identify when models rely on spurious correlations, improving model distillation by adjusting how student models learn from teacher models. The second technique, called "feature sieve," actively erases problematic features identified by early readouts, forcing networks to discover more robust and generalizable features. Testing on benchmark datasets with known biases showed significant improvements in worst-group accuracy and overall performance, with accuracy gains of up to 11 percent on real-world datasets.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/02/intervening-on-early-readouts-for.html

            Google Research engineers developed techniques to make large language models more memory-efficient through optimized mixed-input matrix multiplication. Their approach addresses computational challenges by enabling efficient multiplication between different data types (like 8-bit integers for weights and 16-bit floating point for inputs), reducing memory requirements by up to 4 times compared to single-precision formats. The team created two key software innovations—FastNumericArrayConvertor and FragmentShuffler—that efficiently handle data type conversion and layout conformance on NVIDIA GPUs without significant performance penalties. These optimizations are now available as open-source code in the NVIDIA/CUTLASS repository.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/01/mixed-input-matrix-multiplication.html

            Google Research has developed Exphormer, a sparse transformer architecture specifically designed for graph data that addresses the scalability limitations of traditional graph transformers. The framework leverages expander graphs—sparse yet well-connected structures from spectral graph theory—to replace the computationally expensive complete interaction graphs used in standard transformers. Exphormer constructs an interaction graph combining three types of edges: input graph edges for local attention, constant-degree expander graph edges for global connectivity, and connections to virtual nodes that serve as memory sinks. This approach reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear while maintaining expressiveness and achieving state-of-the-art results on four of five Long Range Graph Benchmark datasets, successfully scaling to graphs with over 170,000 nodes.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/01/exphormer-scaling-transformers-for.html

            Microsoft researchers have created a new lightweight AI model called BitNet that can run efficiently on CPUs rather than requiring specialized GPU hardware. The 1-bit model dramatically reduces computational requirements while maintaining reasonable performance compared to larger models. BitNet represents a significant advancement in making AI more accessible and affordable by enabling language models to run on standard computing hardware. This approach could democratize AI deployment across devices with limited resources and reduce the environmental impact of AI systems.<br><br>Source: news.google.com https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPd2lYOUc2Qm5YWFFsWGRxNHlObGo3TTFaMzlTd1lucktCeER6aGZaR2tpUkZYUG5jYXhsdkZkX3NOekR5OHVvcG1pQi1nNkhjWjZFOTdLZ2l3MEVwN0RUTUR1OWR1MUotR0s5c0RLMzB4aUczdVZyT3lYaU0yV0JubWpkeTN1YThoZFVQaDZiYTZ1ZlFLVm1WaVJTSXJOcEx1TXQ1cUh6RHVNOTVBYktRcFlxWWoyNWhxejZOcWktcUlKS2c?oc=5

            Researchers from MIT, Harvard, and IBM developed a method to make AI systems more resistant to adversarial attacks—subtle manipulations that can trick models into making incorrect predictions. Their approach, called "adversarial smoothing," creates multiple versions of input data with slight variations, then aggregates the model's predictions across these variations to produce more reliable results. The technique significantly improved robustness against adversarial examples in image classification tasks, achieving 62 percent accuracy against attacks that previously reduced accuracy to near zero. The researchers demonstrated the method's effectiveness on various models including ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer.<br><br>Source: Ars Technica https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxNdDlTTDJfekdVRnRrbWh5d3dzWWdRSTkyRnZKYTBkUW42dDBLNGlaY2Q0djlWdmxTXzA1T0Z2MXI3bUZZdmx5RnBRWlNDZVlOalFJQjV1WHhJZktQcUZOMmlrTmhWaXhEMVYtWFhpWHdYb0V2dWpXRnlpUURVU3doT0NsWktsQ3hrVnYtOGxWU3dhQTZvRkdJQ1RXbzlTZXJOTTRacFZiclhXUklhQ3BibEhHSUlUNk9icDg5bzZmYld2SkZi

            Researchers at Columbia University found that while AI systems like GPT-4 can match human performance on certain cognitive tasks, they require significantly more energy to do so. The human brain operates at approximately 20 watts of power, while AI systems need thousands to millions of times more energy for similar tasks. This efficiency gap stems from fundamental differences in architecture—brains use specialized neurons and parallel processing while AI relies on general-purpose computing hardware. The study suggests that neuromorphic computing, which mimics brain structure, may offer a path to more energy-efficient AI systems in the future.<br><br>Source: Columbia University<br>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNOUlGc3Z0Z0hsWWZIVVBGcS0zeFFORWdYRVdMMVhDTU03RFNPcTdOTE1xWEw5V3JqZnNILWI2QmVGcms2eU1FMm84eUZ3N0E4MmhCZHNSOVpmWVVCaUFFY2pic3JHeGxRX2tXUVZTekNzTmdLazR5M083alhrU3dFOHFB?oc=5

            OpenAI launched two new AI models, o3 and o4-mini, with o3 described as the company's most advanced reasoning model yet and o4-mini positioned as a lower-cost alternative. Both models introduce novel capabilities, including the ability to use all ChatGPT tools simultaneously (web browsing, image generation) and enhanced visual processing that allows them to interpret whiteboards, diagrams, and sketches. OpenAI also released Codex CLI, a new coding agent that connects OpenAI's models with developers' local code.
