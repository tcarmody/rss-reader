                        Linus Torvalds created Git in just 10 days in April 2005 after Linux kernel developers lost access to BitKeeper due to licensing issues. The distributed version control system, which Torvalds initially built for his own needs, now powers approximately 98 percent of software development projects worldwide. Torvalds handed off maintenance to Junio Hamano after only four months, focusing on Git's core design principles of performance, distribution, and data integrity through SHA-1 hashing. He attributes Git's success to its decentralized nature, which eliminated the need for centralized repositories and made collaboration significantly easier.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-turns-20-a-qa-with-linus-torvalds/

                        GitHub Security Lab warns that cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) misconfigurations are among the most common vulnerabilities they discover. These issues arise when developers implement overly permissive CORS policies to facilitate third-party connections without fully understanding the security implications. The article examines real-world examples where faulty CORS implementations led to remote code execution, unauthorized credit card charges, and backdoor access. It also discusses DNS rebinding attacks, which exploit DNS resolution to achieve similar effects without requiring configuration errors, and provides specific code examples for proper validation of origins and hostnames.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/security/application-security/localhost-dangers-cors-and-dns-rebinding/

                        Meta likely used books written by former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to train its large language models without permission, according to evidence uncovered by researchers. The team found that when prompted with specific phrases from Adams' autobiography, Meta's Llama 2 model completed the text with high accuracy, suggesting the book was included in training data. This case adds to growing legal challenges from authors against tech companies over unauthorized use of copyrighted materials for AI training. Meta declined to confirm whether Adams' works were used but stated they train models on publicly available content in accordance with terms of service.<br><br>Source: BBC<br>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn911vqng9zo

                        The new tariffs announced by President Trump include a narrow exemption for semiconductors that may create more problems than it solves. While some raw chips are exempt, most semiconductors enter the US already packaged in products like GPUs and servers for AI training, which aren't covered by the exemption. According to analysis of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes, less than one-fifth of Nvidia's products appear to be exempt from the new import duties.

                        Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser confirmed the company plans to implement "variable pricing" for games on its upcoming Switch 2 console. This statement comes amid industry-wide concerns about rising game prices, with many publishers now charging $70 for premium titles. Bowser's comments suggest Nintendo may adopt a similar strategy rather than maintaining its traditional $60 price point for first-party releases, potentially signaling the end of Nintendo's resistance to industry-wide price increases.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com<br>https://venturebeat.com/games/bowsers-pricing-remarks-ninten-dont-offset-switch-2-sticker-shock/

                        DeepSeek has unveiled a new approach called Self-Play Critique Tuning (SPCT) that could overcome limitations in current AI reward models. The technique enables large language models to generate their own critiques without human feedback, potentially making AI systems more scalable and efficient. SPCT works by having the model play both roles in a conversation—generating responses and then critiquing them—creating a self-improving feedback loop. DeepSeek claims this method produces results comparable to models trained with human feedback while requiring fewer resources.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com<br>https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepseek-unveils-new-technique-for-smarter-scalable-ai-reward-models/

                        Dragon Snacks Games has officially emerged from stealth mode with plans to develop community-centered gaming experiences focused on social hubs. The company aims to create "third places" for young gamers—digital spaces that exist between home and school or work where people can gather and socialize. These gaming environments will emphasize joyful experiences and community building rather than purely competitive gameplay. Dragon Snacks Games joins a growing trend of developers prioritizing social connection in gaming environments.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com https://venturebeat.com/games/dragon-snacks-games-will-build-third-places-for-young-gamers/

                        New tariffs on imported goods could severely impact the U.S. battery industry, with lithium-ion batteries from China potentially facing tariffs as high as 132 percent by 2026. China dominates the global battery supply chain, producing over 75 percent of lithium-ion cells and even higher percentages of critical components like cathode and anode materials. Even U.S.-based battery manufacturers rely heavily on Chinese components, making them vulnerable despite domestic production. The economic impact could be substantial, as the U.S. imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China in just the first four months of 2024, and the uncertainty has already led to billions in canceled factory investments.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/09/1114736/tariffs-batteries/

                        Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis developed a system that can detect bird flu in air samples in just five minutes, potentially helping to contain future outbreaks. The device samples air continuously, using specialized aptamers that bind to the virus and create detectable electrical changes when contact occurs. Unlike traditional detection methods that require swabbing and DNA sequencing taking up to 48 hours, this microwave-sized box collects airborne particles in a cyclone-like motion, converting them to liquid samples for immediate testing. While promising, experts note the system still needs testing in real-world farm environments where dirt and other particles could affect performance.<br><br>Source: technologyreview.com https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/09/1114252/new-bird-flu-sensor-disease-outbreaks/

                        Dow Chemical and X-energy applied for a construction permit with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build nuclear reactors at Dow's Seadrift, Texas plant, potentially creating the first factory with onsite nuclear power. The facility will feature four Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactors that use helium-cooled fuel pebbles capable of reaching 1,000°C, providing both steam and electricity to replace aging natural gas infrastructure. The project, partially funded through the Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, could establish a model for industrial decarbonization that data centers and other power-intensive facilities might follow. Operations are expected to begin early next decade, following a regulatory review process that could take up to two and a half years.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/09/1114589/chemical-plant-nuclear/

                        Generative AI models function as imitation engines that seek high-probability outcomes while concealing their sources, unlike human creativity which often pursues innovative, low-probability results. Human authors make conscious decisions about what to remember, believe, and feel, with creativity partly driven by mortality awareness—something AI lacks entirely. The controversy surrounding AI training involves both the unauthorized use of creative works and the reductive assumption that human authors are merely content-generating machines. Unlike human creators who distinguish between inspiration and plagiarism, AI systems have not been programmed with similar ethical considerations.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/09/ai-doesnt-care-about-authors-but-meta-should

The delay stems from a prolonged evaluation process by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which began in October 2023 with recommendations only now being published. Critics argue that Nice lacks the agility needed to evaluate AI technologies at the pace required for effective healthcare innovation.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/04/ai-cancer-screening-rollout-should-be-accelerated-in-the-nhs

                        Twelve copyright lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft have been consolidated into a single case in New York by a U.S. judicial panel, despite opposition from most plaintiff authors and news outlets. The cases involve prominent writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates, Michael Chabon, John Grisham, and Jonathan Franzen, who allege unauthorized use of their works to train AI systems.

                        OpenAI filed a countersuit against Elon Musk on Wednesday, seeking to stop his "nonstop actions" and "fake takeover bid" which they claim are designed to disrupt the company's future. The lawsuit characterizes Musk's recent ninety-seven point four billion dollar offer to buy OpenAI as a "sham bid" unanimously rejected by the board. This legal battle follows Musk's initial lawsuit last spring, which he dropped in June before filing again in August, with the case now scheduled for trial in spring 2026. OpenAI previously published evidence in December suggesting Musk had wanted the company to be for-profit, contradicting his public stance that he wants the company to return to its original mission of developing AGI for humanity's benefit.<br><br>Source: nytimes.com https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/technology/openai-elon-musk-lawsuit.html

                        Major technology companies that donated millions to President Trump's inauguration and hosted events in his honor are now facing adverse policies in his second term. Trump's recent tariffs will increase costs for Apple's supply chain and make AI supercomputer development more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. The administration has reduced funding for AI and quantum computing research while immigration restrictions threaten to limit tech talent access. Regulatory pressure continues with an upcoming antitrust trial against Meta, contributing to a 22 percent drop in the combined market value of major tech companies since the inauguration.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html

                        The U.S. energy sector struggles with severe bottlenecks in gas turbine manufacturing as artificial intelligence data centers create unprecedented electricity demand. Companies seeking the massive metal turbines needed for gas-fired power plants now face three to four-year wait times, double what they were a year ago. Construction costs for these facilities have skyrocketed two to three times higher than just a few years ago, making solar panels and batteries more economical in some regions. This supply chain crisis highlights how AI's rapid growth is reshaping the power industry while challenging the Trump administration's vision of a natural gas renaissance.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/energy-environment/gas-turbines-power-plants.html

This shift could create new economic challenges for cities that have traditionally been centers of professional services and information work.

Firms including Sequoia Capital, GGV Capital, and GSR Ventures have participated in at least 15 funding rounds for Chinese AI companies since October 2022, when the Biden administration imposed export controls. These investments have flowed to companies developing AI applications for healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation, areas not directly targeted by U.S. restrictions.

                        Researchers from Nvidia and other organizations developed a technique that allows AI systems to create coherent, story-driven videos lasting up to a full minute. The method, demonstrated through a Tom and Jerry chase sequence, represents significant progress in extending AI video generation beyond the typical few-second clips. This advancement combines large language models for narrative planning with diffusion models for visual generation, enabling the AI to maintain character consistency and narrative flow throughout longer sequences. The technique addresses previous limitations in temporal coherence that have constrained AI video applications.<br><br>Source: The Decoder<br>https://the-decoder.com/ai-generated-tom-chases-jerry-for-a-full-minute-thanks-to-new-method-from-nvidia-and-others/

                        Dig Ventures has secured 100 million dollars in fresh funding to invest in early-stage European startups. The venture capital firm, founded by former operators including Wise's Taavet Hinrikus and Glovo's Oscar Pierre, represents a growing trend of "operator VCs" in Europe—experienced founders who transition to venture capital. This shift mirrors the U.S. venture capital landscape where most VCs have founding experience, contrasting with Europe's traditional VC makeup of professionals from banking or finance backgrounds.

                        A Waymo autonomous vehicle caused a traffic backup at a Chick-fil-A drive-through in Santa Monica, California this week. The driverless car became trapped in the restaurant's lane, requiring intervention to resolve the situation. Waymo confirmed to TechCrunch that the robotaxi had no passengers onboard during the incident.

                        Waymo launched its first international testing program in Japan, sending about 25 vehicles to collect data on Tokyo's unique driving environment, including left-hand traffic patterns and dense urban areas. Trained drivers from local taxi operator Nihon Kotsu will manually navigate the vehicles across seven central Tokyo wards to gather mapping data on local traffic patterns and road features. While Waymo hasn't confirmed plans for a commercial robotaxi service in Japan, the company has been training drivers and fleet managers from GO, a popular Japanese taxi app, and coordinating with local officials. Waymo currently operates commercial robotaxi services in four U.S. cities with plans to expand to four more.<br><br>Source: The Verge<br>https://www.theverge.com/news/645777/waymo-japan-autonomous-test-robotaxi-international

                        Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Meta executive and whistleblower, testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that CEO Mark Zuckerberg "wears many different costumes" to get closer to power. She alleged that during her 2011-2017 tenure, Meta worked on censorship tools for China and shared American user data with the Chinese Communist Party. Lawmakers from both parties criticized Zuckerberg's attempts to silence Wynn-Williams through legal action and challenged him to testify himself. Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels called her testimony "divorced from reality and riddled with false claims," noting that Meta does not operate services in China today.<br><br>Source: theverge.com https://www.theverge.com/news/646288/congress-zuckerberg-wynn-williams-careless-people

                        President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to investigate former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs. Trump fired Krebs in 2020 after the cybersecurity official publicly contradicted Trump's claims about election fraud. The executive order, signed Wednesday night, targets the former official who had been responsible for securing U.S. election infrastructure and had declared the 2020 election "the most secure in American history."<br><br>Source: techmeme.com<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250409/p50#a250409p50

                        A new MIT study challenges the notion that AI systems naturally develop human-like values through training. Researchers tested multiple large language models (LLMs) including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama 2 to determine if they could identify human preferences without explicit instruction. The study found that while these models can mimic human values when prompted, they don't inherently possess or develop them through training alone. This research has significant implications for AI alignment efforts, suggesting that human values must be deliberately engineered into AI systems rather than emerging naturally through scale or training methods.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOaUxxRFpoZXRCYUJuTDJZVmFNTkR3dWxpTXUtZDkzQTcyNW9ZU2VUdThiN1ZoVTFxbm5xNmkxYlRLcllzTXhCbDhPODItSk41NkYyQ2VfUkhwcGlZZFB1TFpFSURWVEh2Z3loZ1VEeUdJMnpjOW03eG9ZbUZLX2FCdEhoNkNZR3Y0TUdRVEhn?oc=5

                        Economic experts warn that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs are unlikely to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs as intended. Analysts suggest the tariffs could instead accelerate AI adoption and automation as companies seek to offset increased costs rather than expanding domestic production. The policies reflect a backward-looking economic vision focused on recreating mid-20th century industrial conditions rather than preparing for future technological and economic realities. Critics note that manufacturing has fundamentally transformed since the 1950s, with modern production requiring fewer workers due to technological advances.<br><br>Source: news.google.com https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBrOFFhQVE4SUFqbTc3dHNNZjRwc1BvRWhOa1pkZFlrblpKbldLQ0VBY1djdXJoT1k3bmUzWXZBYXBOVVpLblBfdjFmMHNrOGJUQzJGaEhmUms1TVMwNXVDdU1CaVVmVzhKTGFBNg?oc=5

                        The Biden administration backed off plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China following a dinner at Mar-a-Lago where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly paid $1 million. The Commerce Department had initially planned to block shipments of the H20 chip, designed specifically for the Chinese market while complying with U.S. export controls. The decision allows Nvidia to continue selling its specialized AI chips to Chinese customers, maintaining its position in a crucial market that represents about 20 percent of the company's data center business.<br><br>Source: Google News https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFAzd3BuU3gzMWltVGZxd2NHSXA3WEYwNC1wNllyVHU3V0JwdERfbmJxSVBlV1YxZXJYWklpdFRQWHZLX25WeVUzSlhOQzZ5ZTNjYm5qTlY0dUw0OW8xQ0FWWUowcE1JWFdnZmgwdFhQR3pGU3g4cXfSAXtBVV95cUxNU3liU1hyVDdrQXF4eW9KTG93REh2dHlNWFNwWktsTFJmSmRmY1N2ejBTcnRyTnowZGxxQ2MwdWdPdG1tNTJ3cGh6d2

                        A bipartisan group of senators has reintroduced the "No Fakes Act," legislation aimed at protecting individuals from unauthorized AI-generated replicas of their voice, image, or likeness.

                        California's Office of Administrative Law approved new regulations addressing discrimination risks from automated decision tools in employment, set to take effect July 1, 2024. The regulations require employers to analyze how their AI tools might adversely impact individuals based on protected characteristics, maintain records of these assessments, and implement reasonable measures to mitigate discriminatory impacts. Employers must also provide notice to applicants when automated tools are used for employment decisions and ensure their vendors comply with these requirements. The rules apply to California employers with five or more employees who use AI or algorithmic systems for employment decisions.<br><br>Source: The National Law Review https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPdER3QWVIa2xDQU5GVy0wRlJKTFJ5b1B5OTA0QkROcm8zOUd0N3YxMElnR3dGcm9SNlJBNTZtRjJINXpvTGx3OUJSR1hscGNYSmlLOU1MLTRxQVg3NnVqTjZ4ODFqTFhheTFXbXVNZ04zb2FyaDJDOXBzY1Q0YVBUR0FZLWhmOUVUMk83M200Ry1fbGlieXNNRUU5aWM2YWRhel93aDdzdVRLZGlKQWJEbNIBtgFBVV95cUxOSXdlaVFfd185dzNKUUpPTmJYXzNvOUZab

                        Greenpeace reports that the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure in East Asia is undermining climate commitments in the region. Data centers and other AI computing facilities in China, South Korea, and Japan are driving massive increases in electricity consumption, with projections showing AI could consume as much power as entire countries. The environmental organization highlights how tech companies are building new facilities in regions still heavily dependent on coal and other fossil fuels, potentially locking in carbon emissions for decades.

                        The Biden administration reversed course on planned restrictions for Nvidia's H20 AI chip exports to China following CEO Jensen Huang's attendance at a $1 million-per-person dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. The restrictions, which had been in development for months, would have limited Nvidia's ability to sell its China-specific AI accelerators. This policy shift represents a significant win for Nvidia, which has designed specialized chips with reduced capabilities to comply with U.S. export controls while maintaining access to the lucrative Chinese market.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250409/p37#a250409p37

                        Google unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Cloud Next conference, marking the first TPU specifically designed for inference rather than training. The new AI accelerator chip will be available in late 2025 in two configurations: a 256-chip cluster or a massive 9,216-chip cluster. Ironwood represents Google's continued investment in custom silicon to power AI workloads as competition intensifies among cloud providers developing specialized hardware for machine learning operations.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250409/p22#a250409p22
