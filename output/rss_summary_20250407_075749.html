                        Samsung Electronics Co. expects its Q1 2023 operating profit to decline by 21% year-over-year due to weak demand for AI chips and losses in its foundry business. The company&#39;s preliminary earnings guidance indicates an operating profit of approx. $8.3 Bn. U.S. for the quarter, down from $10.5 Bn. U.S. a year earlier. This slowdown in AI chip sales and foundry operations highlights the challenges facing the semiconductor industry as it navigates a global economic downturn.
