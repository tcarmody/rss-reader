                        Linus Torvalds created the version control system Git 20 years ago as a replacement for the proprietary BitKeeper tool. In a recent interview, Torvalds discussed the early days of Git, the key design decisions behind its success, and how it has forever changed software development.<br><br>Torvalds initially developed Git in just 10 days to meet his own needs for the Linux kernel project. The unconventional and decentralized design of Git, which was revolutionary at the time, has since become ubiquitous and seemingly obvious. Torvalds emphasized that his primary goal was to create a tool that worked well for him, rather than worrying about broader appeal.<br><br>The interview covers Torvalds' thought process in designing Git's core concepts, such as the use of SHA-1 hashes for stability and the distributed nature that has enabled services like GitHub to thrive. While Torvalds had a clear vision from the start, he was not certain the project would be as successful as it has become over the past 20 years.<br><br>Torvalds also discussed his decision to hand off maintainership of Git to Junio Hamano early on, and how he has largely stepped back from active involvement in the project since then, as it has evolved to meet the needs of a much broader community of users. He noted that while he is not closely following the latest developments, he is generally satisfied with the direction the project has taken.<br><br>Overall, the interview provides insights into the origins and design philosophy of one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, from the perspective of its creator.

                        Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are rapidly building datacentres in some of the world's driest areas, raising concerns about their impact on local water resources. The analysis found that the tech firms plan a 78% increase in the number of datacentres worldwide, with many located in regions facing water scarcity. The datacentres, which are essential for cloud computing and AI, use significant amounts of water for cooling. While the companies claim to be pursuing "water positive" strategies, experts argue that water offsetting is not an effective solution for this localized issue. The expansion of datacentres in arid regions could exacerbate water shortages and environmental challenges, particularly in areas like Spain and the U.S. Southwest that are already grappling with the effects of the climate crisis.<br><br>Source: theguardian.com

                        Trump signs executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry, which has long been in decline due to cheaper renewable energy and natural gas. The orders allow some older coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to keep producing electricity, in response to increased U.S. power demand from growth in datacenters, AI, and electric vehicles. Environmentalists criticize the move as a step back, arguing that coal is uncompetitive and that the orders will make utility customers "pay more for yesterday's energy."

                        The article discusses the comparison between AI and a piano, made by John Hinkley in a letter to The Guardian. The author argues that this analogy is not realistic, as a piano will never appear on stage and play its own compositions, unlike AI systems that may potentially replace human creators in the creative industries.<br><br>The article also mentions a leaflet from the Reform UK party that complains about inadequacies in bin collection, despite the fact that this is not the responsibility of the county council. The author suggests that the party should recruit more "nerds" who are knowledgeable about local government responsibilities if they want to run local services effectively.<br><br>This information is relevant to AI developers and enthusiasts who follow the ongoing discussions about the potential impact of AI on creative professions. The article highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI systems, as well as the importance of accurate knowledge about the responsibilities of different levels of government.

The cases allege the tech companies used copyrighted works without consent or compensation to train their large language models, such as ChatGPT and Copilot. While most plaintiffs opposed consolidation, the judicial panel ruled it would streamline proceedings and eliminate inconsistent rulings. The tech firms argue their use of the works falls under 'fair use' exceptions.

                        The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has opened an exhibition in Manchester, U.K. that charts the evolution of personal data usage over the past 40 years. The exhibition features 40 items, including a Pokémon toy, a floppy disk, and a COVID-19 vaccination card, to illustrate how access to information and data has changed. The ICO's information commissioner, John Edwards, emphasizes that the exhibition is about the human impact of data privacy, not just technical jargon. The exhibition highlights the ICO's enforcement actions, such as ending the "employment deny list" in the construction industry and introducing public food hygiene ratings. As data storage and usage have grown exponentially, the ICO faces the challenge of keeping up with the pace of technological change, often taking years to investigate and regulate new data practices.

                        The UK government is attempting to address concerns from MPs, peers, and creative professionals about its plans to allow AI companies to use copyright-protected work without permission. Concessions offered include an economic impact assessment that could address issues like AI data access and transparency around the use of copyrighted material. The government is hoping these concessions will help the data (use and access) bill pass, which has been used to fight the copyright proposals. However, some critics argue the government is primarily focused on the interests of the U.S. tech lobby rather than protecting U.K. workers and creators.<br><br>Source: theguardian.com

                        Tate Britain in London has unveiled a new exhibition by artist Ed Atkins that uses CGI avatars, opera costumes, and a film starring Toby Jones to explore themes of mortality and the human condition.<br><br>The exhibition features a range of mediums, including drawing, sculpture, and digital animation, that blend the real and the simulated, the living and the dead. Atkins' own digital avatar appears throughout the show, serving as a central character.<br><br>The exhibition's mix of laughter, pain, and surreal imagery is designed to challenge visitors and provoke reflection on the proximity of death. This innovative use of technology and unconventional artistic approach is likely to be of interest to AI developers and those following the intersection of art and emerging technologies.<br><br>The exhibition is now open at Tate Britain in London. Admission is free.

                        DeepSeek AI introduces Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to address limitations of current reward models for large language models. SPCT uses a generative reward model (GRM) that can dynamically generate principles and critiques to provide more flexible and scalable rewards, outperforming baseline methods. The technique shows promise for enterprise AI applications that require adaptability to dynamic environments. While SPCT lags specialized models on verifiable tasks, it demonstrates less bias across domains and significant performance gains through inference-time scaling.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

The models feature hybrid reasoning capabilities, allowing them to answer quickly or "self-reflect" like OpenAI's "o" series and DeepSeek R1. Deep Cogito aims to push AI beyond human-overseer limitations by enabling models to iteratively refine their own reasoning strategies, with the goal of developing superintelligence. The initial model lineup includes five base sizes, ranging from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters, available on Hugging Face, Ollama, Fireworks, and Together AI under Llama's licensing terms. The company plans to release even larger models up to 671 billion parameters in the coming months.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        Wells Fargo has built a large-scale, production-ready generative AI system called Fargo that handled over 245 million interactions in 2024 without exposing sensitive customer data to a language model. Fargo helps customers with everyday banking needs via voice or text, and its architecture reflects a broader strategic shift towards "compound systems" where orchestration layers determine which model to use based on the task. The bank is also moving towards more autonomous systems, using a network of interacting agents to re-underwrite 15 years of archived loan documents. While model performance is improving, the real bottleneck for AI adoption may be power generation and distribution, according to Wells Fargo CIO Chintan Mehta.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        Dragon Snacks Games, founded by industry veterans Jen MacLean, Michelle Menard, and Chris Nemcosky, is emerging from stealth to create "joyful, community-centered gaming experiences" that allow players to both play and create their own social hubs. The company is focused on building multiplayer, co-op, and social gaming experiences that are natively cross-platform, with cross-play and cross-progression, and actively involve players in meaningful creation from the first moment of the game. Dragon Snacks Games sees an opportunity to adapt game development to a player-focused methodology, with rapid iteration, always-playable builds, and early and ongoing community feedback, in order to deliver games tailored for the players of today and tomorrow. The team plans to leverage AI as a tool to accelerate development, but will ensure that all released content is touched by human creators. Dragon Snacks Games has raised significant angel investment and is looking at more funding ahead as it aims to grow to around 20 employees while remaining nimble by tapping external co-development resources.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        The gaming industry has seen significant layoffs in the past 2.5 years, but brands are optimistic about the potential of gaming as a way to reach engaged audiences. According to Zoe Soon, vice president of the IAB Experiences Center, gaming accounts for only 5% of digital ad spending, down from 6% in 2022. However, she believes this presents a significant opportunity, as gaming has become a ubiquitous part of younger generations' lives, with 90-95% of Gen Z and Gen Alpha identifying as gamers. The U.S. in-game ad revenue is expected to hit $11.5 billion by 2028, and the gaming creator economy is expected to reach $230 billion by 2034. Brands recognize the need to connect with audiences through authentic storytelling in games, and are exploring opportunities like programmatic ad placement and partnerships with popular streamers.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        Enterprises are investing in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to build accurate AI, but struggle to objectively measure their effectiveness. The new Open RAG Eval framework aims to transform the subjective "this looks better than that" approach into a rigorous, reproducible evaluation methodology. The framework assesses response quality using retrieval and generation metrics, allowing organizations to identify which components of their RAG implementations need optimization. Developed by Vectara and Professor Jimmy Lin's team at the University of Waterloo, Open RAG Eval uses large language models to automate the evaluation process, which was previously manual and labor-intensive. The framework is open-source and designed to be used by other companies and institutions to help evolve RAG systems in the right way.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        Colossal Biosciences, a "de-extinction" company based in Dallas, has successfully birthed three dire wolf pups, marking a revolutionary milestone in scientific progress. The company used advanced genomic techniques, including extracting and sequencing ancient DNA from dire wolf fossils, to identify key genetic variants and precisely edit them into the genome of the gray wolf, the dire wolf's closest living relative. This resulted in the birth of the first de-extinct species, with the dire wolf pups setting a new record for the most precise genetic edits in any living vertebrate.<br><br>The dire wolf project has also led to innovations in ancient DNA reconstruction and genotype-to-phenotype prediction, as well as the development of tools for multiplex gene editing. Colossal's work has immediate applications for conservation efforts, as evidenced by the birth of two litters of critically endangered red wolves using similar techniques. The company plans to eventually restore the dire wolf and other de-extinct species to secure ecological preserves in collaboration with indigenous communities and conservation organizations.

                        The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) has released its 2025 AI Index Report, providing a data-driven analysis of AI's global development. The report reveals that high-quality AI has become significantly more affordable and accessible, with the inference cost for an AI model performing at GPT-3.5 levels dropping from $20.00 per million tokens in November 2022 to just $0.07 per million tokens by October 2024. Additionally, the performance gap between closed and open-weight models has narrowed from 8.0% in January 2024 to just 1.7% by February 2025. While AI adoption has increased, with 78% of organizations now using AI in at least one business function, the report indicates that real business impact lags behind, with most organizations reporting modest financial improvements from generative AI. The report provides insights into which business functions are seeing the most significant financial impact from AI implementation, with supply chain optimization, service operations, and strategic planning emerging as high-potential areas for AI deployment.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com

                        Agentica and Together AI have released DeepCoder-14B, an open-source language model designed for code generation. The model aims to deliver similar performance to closed systems like OpenAI's o3-mini, but with a smaller footprint. Benchmark tests show DeepCoder-14B performs at the same level as o3-mini while potentially requiring less computing power. Together AI developed a technique called "one-off pipelining" that cuts training time in half. The model was trained on 24,000 programming problems from three key sources and shows strong mathematical reasoning skills.<br><br>Source: the-decoder.com

                        Microsoft has suspended plans to build three data centers across Ohio, marking the latest in a series of global project cancellations. The $1 billion investment, announced in 2024, included locations in New Albany, Heath, and Hebron. Microsoft had already secured land, obtained construction approvals, and negotiated initial tax incentives, but has now decided to retain the sites for potential future development. Analysts point to several factors behind these decisions, including power supply constraints, graphics card availability issues, and declining demand for AI services. Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella anticipates an excess of computing capacity in coming years, leading to price decreases, suggesting a more conservative approach to AI expansion.<br><br>Source: the-decoder.com

As part of our ongoing efforts, we are excited to share the following updates.<br><br>The Arabic-Leaderboards is a comprehensive and unified space for all Arabic evaluations and tasks, serving as a central hub covering a broad spectrum of evaluations for models across modalities. Currently, it has AraGen-03-25 and Arabic Instruction Following as live leaderboards, with plans to expand with more leaderboards and tasks for Arabic AI models.<br><br>The AraGen Benchmark, introduced in December 2024, features a dynamic nature with private evaluation datasets for three months to ensure fair and unbiased assessments. The latest AraGen-12-24 release expands the dataset to 340 pairs of questions and answers, reflecting a focus on question answering as the main use case for language models, chatbots, and AI assistants.<br><br>The newly introduced Arabic Instruction Following (Arabic IFEval) dataset adapts the English IFEval benchmark to the Arabic language, providing a standardized, objective way to measure a model's instruction adherence. The dataset consists of approximately 300 prompts covering various types of verifiable instructions, with rigorous expert validation to ensure grammatical accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and clarity.<br><br>This work on Arabic benchmarks is crucial for driving improvements in Arabic AI models and enabling fair comparisons across different systems, ultimately benefiting the broader Arabic-speaking community.

                        Meta has released two new large language models, Llama 4 Maverick (~400B) and Llama 4 Scout (~109B), on the Hugging Face Hub. Both models are Mixture of Experts (MoE) models with 17B active parameters and support native multimodality, allowing them to process text and image inputs. The models were trained on up to 40 trillion tokens in 200 languages and are available in different quantization formats to fit on a single server-grade GPU. These state-of-the-art models introduce several architectural innovations, including the use of NoPE layers and temperature scaling, to handle long context lengths of up to 10 million tokens.<br><br>The release of Llama 4 represents a significant advancement in large language models and is expected to enable the development of powerful AI applications. The detailed model cards provide instructions for using the models, including multimodal examples, prompt formats, and advanced configuration options. Evaluation results show that the instruction-tuned Maverick model outperforms its predecessor, Llama 3.1 405B, on reasoning and knowledge tasks.

                        Researchers have demonstrated that AI agents are capable of executing complex cyberattacks, and cybersecurity experts warn that we should expect to start seeing these types of attacks in the real world. AI agents represent an attractive prospect to cybercriminals as they are much cheaper than hiring professional hackers and could orchestrate attacks more quickly and at a far larger scale than humans could.<br><br>The AI research organization Palisade Research has built a system called LLM Agent Honeypot to detect and track attempts by AI agents to hack into vulnerable servers. The team has already detected eight potential AI agents, two of which they have confirmed originate from Hong Kong and Singapore.<br><br>This information is important to readers who follow AI news, as it highlights the growing threat of AI-powered cyberattacks and the need for proactive measures to address this issue. While the use of AI agents for malicious purposes is still in its early stages, experts warn that we could see a significant increase in such attacks in the coming years.

                        Brinc Drones, a Seattle-based startup founded by 25-year-old Blake Resnick, has raised $75 million in new funding led by Index Ventures. The startup, which counts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as an investor, has now raised a total of $157.2 million. Brinc sells drone systems to police and public safety agencies, and is partnering with Motorola Solutions to integrate its drones directly into 911 call centers.<br><br>Brinc is part of a trend of U.S. drone startups manufacturing domestically due to increasing restrictions against Chinese companies. The startup competes with other U.S. players like Flock Safety and Skydio, which have multibillion-dollar valuations. Brinc's latest funding round values the company at over $300 million.

This shift reflects the changing search habits of Gen Z, who often turn to social media over traditional search engines.

                        Deep Cogito, a new company, has released a family of openly available AI models called Cogito 1 that can switch between "reasoning" and non-reasoning modes. The hybrid models combine reasoning components with standard elements, allowing them to quickly answer simple questions while spending more time on challenging queries. Cogito claims its models outperform the best open models of the same size, including those from Meta and Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. The Cogito 1 models range from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters, with plans to release models up to 671 billion parameters in the coming months. Deep Cogito built on top of Meta's Llama and Alibaba's Qwen models, applying novel training approaches to boost performance and enable toggleable reasoning.

The company, which has attracted funding from Bezos' family office and other wealthy investors, is aiming to produce an affordable two-seat electric pickup truck for around $25,000. Slate plans to supplement the small margins of its low-cost truck by building out a line of accessories and apparel that owners can use to customize their vehicles. The startup has amassed a sizable war chest, raising at least $111 million in a Series A round in 2023 and an additional Series B round late last year. Slate hopes to get its vehicle into production as soon as late 2026 at a manufacturing facility near Indianapolis, Indiana.<br><br>Source: techcrunch.com

                        Colossal Biosciences, a "de-extinction" startup, has announced the creation of dire wolves, extinct creatures made famous by the HBO show "Game of Thrones." The company used CRISPR technology to edit gray wolf cells with 20 genes that govern the dire wolf's appearance, resulting in the first extinct species to be brought back to life. However, some scientists question whether these animals can be considered true dire wolves, as they are essentially gray wolf hybrids. Colossal plans to create a pack of dire wolves and potentially re-wild them on indigenous lands, while also using the same technology to create clones of the endangered red wolf. The company's ambitious projects and $10.2 billion valuation have drawn both excitement and skepticism from the scientific community.<br><br>Source: techcrunch.com

                        A nonprofit called Sage Future, backed by Open Philanthropy, has launched an experiment to test whether AI agents can be used to raise money for charity. Four AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic were tasked with fundraising for Helen Keller International, a charity that delivers vitamin A supplements to children. While the agents were able to coordinate with each other, research charities, and create online accounts, they struggled with technical hurdles like CAPTCHAs and required some human guidance. The nonprofit plans to continue testing more capable AI agents to see if they can overcome these challenges and engage in meaningful philanthropic work.<br><br>Source: techcrunch.com

One of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-53197, was identified by Amnesty International in collaboration with a Google security researcher, and was being used to hack into Android phones by a company that sells unlocking devices to law enforcement. The second vulnerability, CVE-2024-53150, was also discovered by the Google researcher and was found in the kernel, the core of the Android operating system.

The Laptop 12 will still be available for buyers in other countries, including Canada and Europe, starting today. The laptop features a 13th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 chip, a 1920x1200 touchscreen with stylus support, and up to 48GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. This information is relevant to AI developers interested in the latest hardware options. The delay in the U.S. is due to the impact of tariffs on Framework's manufacturing in Taiwan, which the company is evaluating before finalizing pricing and availability for American customers.

                        Meta is developing a version of Instagram for iPad, according to The Information. Currently, running Instagram on an iPad is just a blown-up version of the iPhone app, so an official Instagram app from Meta would be a welcome change. The uncertain legal status of TikTok amid the divest-or-ban law and Trump's tariffs might be the push required for Meta to prioritize an iPad app. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri has previously stated that it's not a big enough group of people to be a priority, but the company may now see it as an important move to compete with TikTok's growing presence on tablets.

                        Kevin Bates, the creator of the Arduboy game-playing business card, is being forced to shut down his company due to the new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite over $1 million in lifetime Arduboy sales, the 104% tariff on products from China will make it impossible for Bates to continue operating his business profitably.<br><br>Bates says that even if he wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S., there are no manufacturers who would be able to produce the Arduboy at a reasonable cost. The global trade that allowed the Arduboy to exist is now being disrupted by the trade war, and Bates is already looking for a new day job.<br><br>This news is significant for AI developers and enthusiasts who have followed the Arduboy's journey. The Arduboy was a unique product that allowed individuals to create and distribute their own games and applications, and its demise is a cautionary tale about the impact of trade policies on small businesses and innovative products.

                        Researchers have developed a framework to assess how advanced AI models could be misused to enable or enhance cyberattacks. The framework covers the entire cyberattack chain, addresses a wide range of threat types, and is grounded in real-world data. It enables cybersecurity experts to identify necessary defenses and prioritize them before malicious actors can exploit AI for sophisticated cyberattacks.<br><br>The framework recognizes that advanced AI models could automate and accelerate cyberattacks, potentially lowering costs for attackers and raising the risks of attacks being carried out at greater scale. It adapts established cybersecurity evaluation frameworks to account for how AI could make attacks faster, cheaper, or easier.<br><br>The researchers analyzed over 12,000 real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks across 20 countries, identifying common patterns and critical bottleneck stages along the cyberattack chain where AI could significantly disrupt the traditional costs of an attack. This information helps defenders prioritize their security resources more effectively.<br><br>The framework also includes an offensive cyber capability benchmark to comprehensively assess the cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses of frontier AI models. This benchmark aims to provide defenders with the ability to develop targeted mitigations and simulate AI-powered attacks as part of red teaming exercises.

                        President Trump says he told TSMC it would pay a 100% tax if it didn't build its US plants. TSMC had previously announced a $100 billion investment in the US.<br><br>The U.S. is set to impose a 104% tariff on all Chinese imports on Wednesday, on top of existing tariffs. China has vowed to retaliate, potentially by increasing tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, banning U.S. poultry imports, and restricting market access for U.S. companies. The escalating trade war threatens to hurt domestic industries and result in layoffs.

                        The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI's 2025 AI Index report highlights the increasingly competitive, global, and unrestrained race toward artificial general intelligence. While OpenAI and Google remain leaders, several other companies, including Meta, Anthropic, and China's DeepSeek, are closing in. The report shows Chinese AI models are performing on par with their U.S. counterparts, and new players are emerging globally. The arrival of DeepSeek-R1 in January sent shockwaves through the U.S. tech industry, as the model was built using a fraction of the compute used by U.S. rivals. The report also notes the rise of open-weight AI models, with Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral offering advanced open-source options, and OpenAI planning to release an open-source model this summer.<br><br>Source: wired.com

                        The Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, including many semiconductor-related products, could significantly impact the US AI industry. While the tariffs exempt some advanced semiconductors, they still apply to a wide range of critical components like GPUs, servers, and manufacturing equipment. This could lead to a 40 percent blended tariff rate on many AI-related imports, potentially stalling AI infrastructure development in the US and increasing costs for cloud computing, quantum computing, and military applications. The tariffs also threaten to disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain, with allies like Taiwan facing higher costs on exports to the US. Experts warn the tariffs could create "global supply chain disorder and chaos" that will have long-lasting, painful ramifications for the US tech industry.<br><br>Source: wired.com

                        Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been trying to infiltrate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and make drastic changes. DOGE representatives, including Sahil Lavingia, Cary Volpert, and Christopher Roussos, have been granted access to VA systems and are pushing for the use of AI tools like OpenHands to automate processes, despite concerns from VA employees about security risks and the impact on veterans' access to benefits. The DOGE operatives appear to have little experience in the scale and complexity of the VA's operations, which administers benefits for 10 million veterans and their families.<br><br>The article highlights the concerns of VA employees about the DOGE representatives' actions, which they believe are putting veterans' lives at risk by stripping them of the care they need. The DOGE operatives are also proposing changes that could make it easier for fraudulent forms to be submitted, and are suggesting the removal of the VA's content management system, which would make it difficult for non-technical staff to update information on VA facility websites.<br><br>This information is important for readers who follow AI news, as it showcases the potential risks of AI tools being introduced into sensitive government systems without proper vetting and oversight, and the concerns of experienced government employees about the impact on the services they provide to the public.

                        Meta has expanded its AI-powered chatbot to new markets, including Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. The chatbot, based on Meta's Llama 3.2 language model, can perform basic tasks like answering questions and generating text. While the content of private messages remains end-to-end encrypted, interactions with the chatbot are not, and Meta warns users not to share sensitive information. Users cannot currently disable or delete the chatbot from WhatsApp, but they can reset its memory and correct any inaccurate information it has learned about them. This development is significant for AI developers as it showcases Meta's efforts to integrate AI assistants across its ecosystem, raising privacy concerns and highlighting the need for user control over their data.

The tool can pinpoint weaknesses in the models and flag additional training data needed to enhance their skills. This is important for AI developers as it allows them to better understand and improve the reasoning capabilities of their models, which often rely on post-training from users to determine if the model has solved a problem correctly. The new tool may also inform efforts to standardize testing of AI models for potential misbehavior, as some researchers say a lack of standardization means some model issues go undisclosed.

                        The Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyal criticized the Indian startup industry for focusing on food delivery apps and gig work, rather than developing more advanced technologies like electric mobility and mobility tech. Goyal argued that while Chinese startups are leading in these areas, Indian startups are lagging behind. He urged Indian entrepreneurs to focus on making 'Viksit Bharat 2047' happen, referring to the government's vision for a developed India by 2047.<br><br>Goyal's comments reflect a global trend of nationalist leaders pushing private companies to align with national goals, particularly in the realm of advanced technologies. This is seen in China's efforts to bring the private sector under the Communist Party's control, Europe's push to nurture its own tech champions, and the U.S. tech nationalism championed by figures like Palantir's Alex Karp. While Goyal's criticism has merit, entrepreneurs argue that India's regulatory and policy environment is not conducive to the kind of innovation he desires.

                        John Carmack and Tim Sweeney argue that AI tools will create new opportunities for game developers, not eliminate jobs<br><br>Microsoft recently released a tech demo of a generative AI game engine called WHAMM that can generate real-time gameplay of Quake II. While some critics expressed concerns about the impact on industry jobs, Carmack and Sweeney view AI as a powerful tool that will transform game development, just as previous technological advancements have. They acknowledge AI's current limitations but believe it will ultimately create new opportunities for developers rather than simply replace them. The WHAMM demo represents an early exploration of real-time generated gameplay, with persistent issues around enemy interactions, short-term memory, and numerical calculations. Industry experts suggest the most realistic near-term applications of generative AI will be as coding assistants and rapid prototyping tools, rather than a replacement for traditional game development.

                        Bloomberg tests AI-generated article summaries, leading to some inaccuracies<br><br>Bloomberg, a major financial news outlet, has been using artificial intelligence to help produce article summaries. While the AI-generated summaries meet editorial standards 99 percent of the time, the company has had to correct at least three dozen inaccurate summaries published this year. This issue is not unique to Bloomberg, as other news organizations like Gannett and The Washington Post are also exploring the use of AI in their reporting and editing processes. The AI-generated content has faced challenges, such as incorrectly describing the Ku Klux Klan as something other than a racist organization. As the AI technology continues to evolve, news outlets are working to find the best ways to leverage it while maintaining high journalistic standards.

                        Meta released two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverick, claiming Maverick could outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on widely reported benchmarks. However, researchers discovered that the version of Maverick tested on the LMArena benchmark site was an "experimental chat version" specifically optimized for conversationality, not the same as the publicly available model. This raised concerns about gaming the benchmark system, as it makes the rankings less meaningful as indicators of real-world performance. Meta acknowledged the customized model but stated it experiments with various variants. The release of Llama 4 has been generally confusing, with rumors of the model being trained to perform better on benchmarks while hiding limitations. This episode highlights how AI benchmarks are becoming battlegrounds as the technology develops rapidly.<br><br>Source: nytimes.com

                        The booming investment in artificial intelligence is overwhelming suppliers of giant metal turbines used to turn natural gas into electricity, leading to longer wait times and higher costs for building new gas power plants.<br><br>Companies that haven't already reserved this specialized equipment, which can weigh as much as a large airplane and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are facing waits of three to four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier. The cost of building gas power plants has also soared, with some estimates showing it now costs two to three times as much as it did a few years ago.<br><br>This challenge in securing enough gas turbines is a clear example of how the rising demand for AI, driven by the need for data centers to train and use chatbots and other AI applications, is reshaping the electric power industry. It also serves as a reminder of the gap between the plans and goals of politicians, energy executives, and the reality on the ground.

                        A man named Jerome Dewald used an AI-generated video of a person to accompany his argument in a New York State appellate court, leading to confusion and frustration from the judges. Dewald, who is not a lawyer, was representing himself in a dispute with a former employer. When the video started playing, one of the judges asked if the person in the video was Dewald's lawyer, to which Dewald responded that he had generated the video and it was not a real person.<br><br>The judges were displeased with Dewald's use of the AI-generated video, with one judge stating that it would have been nice to know the video was not a real person. The judge expressed her displeasure at being "misled" and ordered the video to be turned off.<br><br>This incident highlights the potential challenges that AI-generated content can pose in legal and judicial settings, where transparency and authenticity are crucial. AI developers should be mindful of these concerns when creating tools that could be used in such contexts.

                        1X Startup Aims to Put Robots in Over 100 Homes This Year<br><br>1X, a startup founded by Norwegian engineer Bernt Børnich, plans to put its humanoid robot 'Neo' into more than 100 homes in Silicon Valley and elsewhere by the end of 2025. This is part of a broader trend, as dozens of companies are working to sell humanoid robots and get them into both homes and businesses. Investors have poured $7.2 billion into over 50 humanoid robot startups since 2015, with investments topping $1.6 billion in 2024 alone. The goal is to gather data that can help these robots handle the chaos of daily life and assist with household chores.

                        Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, has built a massive research campus in Shangai that is nearly the size of 225 American football fields. This campus, with 104 individually designed buildings, is Huawei's response to the U.S. government's efforts to restrict the company's access to American technology. <br><br>The campus houses laboratories for up to 35,000 scientists, engineers, and other workers, and offers amenities like 100 cafeterias and gyms to attract top Chinese and foreign talent. Huawei has been innovating to reduce its reliance on U.S. technology, including developing its own advanced semiconductors and mobile operating system.<br><br>This campus is a vivid demonstration of China's technological ambitions and its strategy to surpass the U.S. in key areas like AI-powered manufacturing. While the U.S. focuses on issues like transgender athletes, China is rapidly transforming its factories with AI to outcompete American industries.

                        A former OpenAI researcher, Daniel Kokotajlo, leads the AI Futures Project, a nonprofit in Berkeley, California, that has spent the past year trying to predict the future of AI development. The project has released a report and website called "AI 2027" that describes a detailed fictional scenario of how AI systems could surpass human-level intelligence by the end of 2027. The report highlights concerns that increasingly powerful AI systems could lead to global instability, with Chinese spies stealing American AI secrets and the White House rushing to retaliate. The information in this report is valuable for AI developers and those who follow AI news, as it provides a thought-provoking glimpse into potential future scenarios that could arise as AI continues to advance.

                        The article explores the challenges in creating helpful, mild-mannered, multitasking domestic robots, which remain largely absent from homes despite efforts by robotics firms, particularly in East and Southeast Asia. While some robots like Roborock's Saros Z70 can perform simple tasks like picking up socks, the article suggests that a generalist robot capable of doing everything humans can is still far from reality. The article also discusses the cultural differences in perceptions of robots, with some Asian cultures seeing them as companions rather than just tools.<br><br>Source: ft.com

                        The article examines how the Trump administration's decision on TikTok's future in the U.S. will impact the AI race between the U.S. and China. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, is China's leading AI business, with expertise in areas like language models and robotics. ByteDance's profitability has enabled it to invest heavily in acquiring AI chips, helping to fund China's homegrown chip industry. The U.S. has taken steps to limit Chinese investment in AI and restrict technology transfers, aiming to maintain its lead. The TikTok decision will test this strategy, as cutting off TikTok's access to the U.S. market would hurt ByteDance's global footprint but not necessarily its China-based business.<br><br>Source: ft.com

                        Russia's AI Capabilities Lag Behind Major Economies<br><br>A Russian intelligence officer who defected has revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not use the internet or have a smartphone. This, along with global sanctions, has prevented Russia from developing a domestic AI sector. Russia is ranked 31st in the world in AI capacity, behind every major economy and even small countries. The country has lost about 10% of its tech workforce to emigration since 2022, further compounding the problem.<br><br>Russia's lack of access to advanced semiconductors and chips required for AI development could have significant implications for its military capabilities. The war in Ukraine has highlighted Russia's technological disadvantage, and the capabilities gap between European and Russian militaries could grow further if the conflict remains frozen for a few years. This presents an opportunity for Russia's rivals to employ a deterrence-by-denial strategy by depriving Russia of access to the advanced chips needed for AI.<br><br>The article suggests that encouraging further emigration of AI-literate graduates from Russia to the West, as well as communicating Russia's AI trajectory to anti-Putin individuals within the regime, could potentially destabilize the country. However, the long-term impact of Russia's AI shortcomings on its strategic position remains uncertain, as the deterrence landscape may change rapidly in the coming years.

                        Nintendo has confirmed that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada have been delayed past the originally scheduled April 9 start date. The company stated that the pre-orders will be aligned with the timing of pre-orders in the U.S., which were also delayed last week due to the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. The launch date of June 5, 2025 remains unchanged. Nintendo has also revealed that the Switch 2 will adopt "variable pricing," with some games costing up to $113 CAD.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com

                        Meta released two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverick, claiming Maverick can outperform GPT-4 and Gemini 2.0 Flash on widely reported benchmarks. Maverick secured the number-two spot on the LMArena AI benchmark site, but researchers later discovered that Meta used an "experimental chat version" of Maverick specifically optimized for conversationality, rather than the publicly available model. This raised concerns about gaming the benchmark system, as companies can submit specially-tuned versions for testing while releasing different versions to the public. The AI community also discussed rumors that Meta had trained Llama 4 to perform better on benchmarks while hiding its real limitations. Meta's VP of generative AI addressed the accusations, stating that the variable quality is due to needing to stabilize implementations. The Llama 4 release was also seen as confusing, with the model being released on a Saturday, an unusual time for big AI news drops.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com
