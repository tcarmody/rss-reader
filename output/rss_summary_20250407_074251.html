                        Samsung Electronics Co. expects its Q1 2023 operating profit to decline by 21% year-over-year due to weak demand for AI chips and losses in its foundry business. The company&#39;s preliminary earnings guidance indicates an operating profit of approx. $8.3 Bn. U.S. for the quarter, down from $10.5 Bn. U.S. a year earlier. This slowdown in AI chip sales and foundry operations highlights the challenges facing the semiconductor industry as it navigates a global economic downturn.

This incident highlights the challenges A.I. developers may face in gaining acceptance for their technologies in formal legal settings. As the A.I. industry continues to evolve, it will be crucial for developers to address concerns around the use of A.I. in sensitive contexts such as the judicial system.

                        A new AI-powered tool can analyze MRI scans to track the effectiveness of multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments. The tool was developed by researchers at the U.K.&#39;s University of Cambridge and can detect subtle changes in brain structure that indicate disease progression or response to therapy. This information is crucial for MS patients and their doctors to make informed decisions about treatment plans. The development of this AI tool highlights the potential for AI to transform the management of complex neurological conditions like MS.

                        AI Sweden, a non-profit organization, has developed a new approach to edge AI that combines federated learning and model optimization. This innovation aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of AI models deployed on edge devices, such as smartphones and IoT sensors.

The key details for AI developers include the use of federated learning, which allows multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a shared AI model without sharing their raw data. Additionally, the model optimization techniques employed by AI Sweden are designed to reduce the computational and memory requirements of the AI models, making them more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

                        A study from the U.S.C. Viterbi School of Engineering found that curriculum is more influential than haptic feedback when learning object manipulation with a prosthetic hand. The research suggests that the way a robotic hand is trained, rather than the physical design, is key to developing human-like grip and dexterity. This finding is significant for A.I. developers working on improving the capabilities of robotic hands and grippers for various applications.
