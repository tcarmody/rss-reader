The company will begin notifying EU users this week about data usage for AI training, providing an objection form for those who wish to opt out. Meta emphasized it won't use private messages or data from users under 18 for training purposes.

            Meta argues the FTC's attempt to undo its decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp ignores market realities and competition. The company claims it transformed these platforms through billions in investment, growing Instagram to over two billion monthly users and evolving WhatsApp into a free, encrypted messaging service with similar reach. Meta contends the FTC has artificially narrowed the competitive landscape, noting that TikTok and YouTube capture more user time than Facebook or Instagram, and that when properly defined, Meta holds less than 30 percent market share.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ftcs-weak-case-against-meta-ignores-reality/

            Princeton University researchers released HELMET, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs) across diverse applications. The benchmark addresses limitations in existing evaluation methods by offering controllable input lengths from 8,000 to 128,000 tokens, reliable model-based metrics, and support for both instruction-tuned and base models. After testing 59 LCLMs, researchers found that performance varies significantly across different tasks, with proprietary models outperforming open-source alternatives on complex tasks and all models showing context-dependent performance degradation.<br><br>Source: huggingface.co https://huggingface.co/blog/helmet

            GitHub launched sub-issues, a new feature that enables users to break larger issues into smaller, hierarchical tasks within a single issue. The feature creates a nested structure that helps teams track progress, manage dependencies, and maintain organization across complex projects. GitHub built sub-issues using a straightforward MySQL relationship model and exposed them through GraphQL endpoints, leveraging existing React components and new list-view elements. The development team practiced "dogfooding" by using sub-issues to build the feature itself, which helped identify improvements like adding issue numbers and repository names to sub-issue displays.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/introducing-sub-issues-enhancing-issue-management-on-github/

            The open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained widespread adoption as a standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools. Inspired by Microsoft's Language Server Protocol from 2016, MCP addresses the context problem where LLMs struggle with information outside their training data by providing a standardized way to feed relevant context into AI systems. GitHub recently released an official local GitHub MCP Server that integrates with GitHub APIs, enabling developers to build more robust AI solutions. The protocol's model-agnostic design allows anyone to create MCP integrations, making it increasingly valuable as adoption grows.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/llms/what-the-heck-is-mcp-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/

            Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5 billion financial hit after new U.S. restrictions require special licenses to sell its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers. The U.S. government imposed these controls to prevent the chips from being used in Chinese supercomputers, expanding previous export controls that already blocked Nvidia's most powerful chips from the Chinese market. Nvidia will take the $5.5 billion charge in the quarter ending April 27 for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.

Gates shared this perspective during a recent discussion, suggesting that humans "weren't born to do jobs" and that AI could free people to pursue more meaningful activities. He envisions a future where the workweek could be reduced to three days as AI handles routine tasks, though he acknowledges this transition will require significant societal adaptation.<br><br>Source: Times Now News<br>https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/bill-gates-predicts-ai-will-replace-most-jobs-in-20-years-we-werent-born-to-do-jobs-article-151434828

This development represents another escalation in U.S. efforts to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductor technology used for AI development.<br><br>Source: Reuters<br>https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-kept-some-china-customers-dark-about-new-us-chip-clampdown-sources-say-2025-04-16/

            Bill Gates believes artificial intelligence will significantly impact healthcare and education jobs, two sectors previously considered resistant to technological disruption. In a recent blog post, Gates explained that AI could help address labor shortages by automating aspects of doctors' and teachers' work, potentially reducing the need for as many professionals in these fields. He suggested this automation could lead to more free time for workers across industries, though he acknowledged the transition would require careful management. Gates emphasized that AI would likely create new types of jobs while eliminating others, continuing a pattern seen throughout technological history.<br><br>Source: Business Insider https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-ai-job-shortages-doctors-teachers-work-free-time-2025-4

            The U.S. technology strategy has pivoted from globalization to reshoring, with stark differences between presidential approaches. Biden's institutional method of grants and incentives has stalled, leaving projects like Intel's Ohio campus incomplete, while Trump favors direct executive pressure and tariff threats that prompted Nvidia's recent U.S. supercomputer plans. This shift highlights how American tech dominance increasingly relies on controlling critical chokepoints in AI infrastructure rather than invention itself. The emerging industrial policy now operates more through presidential demands than structured policy frameworks, raising concerns as the U.S. faces potential international backlash over changing trade relationships.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-industrial-policy-inward-turn-by-ultimatum

            Renowned American artist David Salle has unveiled a new series called "New Pastorals" at Thaddaeus Ropac gallery in London, featuring works created with machine-learning software. The monumental canvases combine AI-generated digital underpainting with Salle's own hand-applied oil paint gestures, creating a hybrid form that questions the relationship between human and machine creativity. Salle, who rose to art world prominence in the 1980s, has been training AI models on his previous works since 2023, allowing the technology to generate compositions that he then modifies and enhances. The exhibition explores whether AI can produce genuinely new artistic expressions or merely recombine existing styles.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/15/david-salle-ai-art-school-postmodern-master

The AI firm claims Musk has "made it his project to take down OpenAI" and is using litigation to slow the company's progress for his personal benefit. This escalates the feud between Musk, who helped found OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015, and the company he left after disagreements over its direction and control.

            Black Mirror has evolved beyond science fiction to become a form of "science folklore" that significantly influences public attitudes toward technology. The show assigns negative allegories to innovations—depicting smartphones as tools of social stratification, robot dogs as predatory hunters, and AI as a form of necromancy—effectively channeling and amplifying collective anxieties about technological advancement. While the series earns praise for its masterful production, questions arise about whether its consistently pessimistic framing of technology deserves the outsized influence it holds over cultural discourse around innovation.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/black-mirror-tv-show-pessimism

            Generative AI models function as imitation engines that seek high-probability outcomes while concealing their sources, unlike human creativity which often pursues innovative, low-probability results. Human authors make conscious decisions about what to remember, believe, and feel, with creativity partly driven by mortality awareness—something AI lacks entirely. The controversy surrounding AI training involves both the unauthorized use of creative works and the reductive assumption that human authors are merely content-generating machines. Unlike human creators who distinguish between inspiration and plagiarism, AI systems have not been programmed with similar ethical considerations.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/09/ai-doesnt-care-about-authors-but-meta-should

            Arnhildur Pálmadóttir, an Icelandic architect, has spent five years developing "Lavaforming," a visionary project that proposes using molten lava from volcanic eruptions as a sustainable building material. Working with her son Arnar Skarphéðinsson, she has identified three potential techniques: drilling into magma pockets, channeling lava into pre-dug trenches to form foundations, or 3D-printing bricks from molten lava. The concept leverages Iceland's 30 active volcanoes and addresses the construction industry's massive carbon footprint, which currently contributes 37 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions. Pálmadóttir will present a speculative film set in 2150 depicting a fictional lava-built city at the Venice Biennale in May.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/15/1114406/architect-arnhildur-palmadottir-cities-lava-volcanos/

            U.S. Marines deployed in the Pacific last year used generative AI chatbots to analyze surveillance data, marking a significant evolution in military AI applications. This represents the second phase of Pentagon's AI adoption, following the 2017 launch of computer vision initiatives like Project Maven. The military's AI implementation is raising concerns among safety experts about whether large language models are suitable for analyzing intelligence in high-stakes geopolitical situations, particularly as these systems move closer to suggesting military actions. Key questions emerging include the practical limitations of "human in the loop" safeguards, challenges in information classification when AI can compile insights from unclassified sources, and how high in the decision-making chain AI should be permitted to operate.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/15/1115078/phase-two-of-military-ai-has-arrived/

            Manufacturing faces multiple crises including geopolitical supply chain disruptions, labor shortages with over 500,000 unfilled U.S. jobs, and climate change pressures. Advanced automation technologies—industrial AI, digital twins, IoT, and robotics—offer solutions with documented benefits including 50 percent downtime reduction through predictive maintenance and 15 percent carbon emissions cuts via digital twins. Despite these advantages, widespread adoption remains slow due to workforce capability gaps and financial barriers, particularly for small and medium enterprises with legacy systems.

            Nvidia disclosed that the U.S. government plans to restrict sales of additional AI chips to China, expanding beyond previous export controls. The new restrictions will affect Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier regulations limiting computational power. This escalation reflects growing concerns about China's access to advanced AI technology that could enhance military capabilities. The move will likely disrupt Nvidia's significant revenue stream from Chinese customers and could accelerate China's efforts to develop domestic alternatives.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/nvidia-h20-chip-china-restrictions.html

            OpenAI has dramatically reduced the time allocated for safety testing its latest AI models from months to mere days, according to eight people familiar with the company's processes. Testers of the upcoming o3 model report having less than a week for safety evaluations that previously took six months for GPT-4. The accelerated timeline stems from competitive pressures as OpenAI races against Meta, Google, and Elon Musk's xAI to maintain market leadership in the $300 billion AI industry.

            Microsoft researchers found that longer reasoning chains in large language models don't necessarily indicate higher intelligence and can actually introduce more errors. Their study shows that while step-by-step reasoning helps models solve problems, extending these chains beyond optimal lengths leads to performance degradation. The researchers observed that models tend to introduce errors when forced to generate longer explanations, suggesting that simply scaling up compute and context length may not be the most effective approach to improving AI reasoning capabilities. The findings challenge the prevailing assumption that more compute and longer contexts automatically yield better AI systems.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com https://venturebeat.com/ai/when-ai-reasoning-goes-wrong-microsoft-research-shows-more-tokens-can-mean-more-problems/

            Current AI benchmarks like ARC provide limited insight into genuine intelligence capabilities. While models can achieve perfect scores on tests through memorization or pattern recognition, these metrics fail to capture the nuanced, adaptive nature of true intelligence. The AI community increasingly recognizes the need for more sophisticated evaluation frameworks that assess reasoning, generalization, and novel problem-solving rather than performance on static datasets. Projects like GAIA aim to develop benchmarks that better reflect intelligence as an emergent property of complex systems rather than a single numerical score.<br><br>Source: VentureBeat<br>https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-arc-agi-gaia-and-the-search-for-a-real-intelligence-benchmark/

            The race toward larger context windows in large language models (LLMs) continues with models now supporting millions of tokens, but these expansions may not translate to proportional business value. While extended context enables applications like processing entire codebases or lengthy documents, most enterprise use cases require only modest context lengths of several thousand tokens. The computational costs increase substantially with larger context windows, with inference costs growing linearly or superlinearly with context length, potentially making multi-million token models economically impractical for many applications.<br><br>Source: VentureBeat<br>https://venturebeat.com/ai/bigger-isnt-always-better-examining-the-business-case-for-multi-million-token-llms/

            Nvidia disclosed in a Tuesday filing that the U.S. government has imposed new export controls on its H20 AI chips designed for the Chinese market. The semiconductor giant must now obtain a license to export these chips to China, with the requirement applying indefinitely. This regulatory action represents another escalation in U.S. efforts to restrict China's access to advanced AI hardware. The H20 chip was specifically developed by Nvidia to comply with previous export restrictions while still serving the Chinese market.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/

            Elon Musk's Starlink has rapidly grown to become Nigeria's second-largest pure-play internet service provider, accumulating more than 65,000 subscribers since entering the market in January 2023. The satellite internet service has gained popularity due to its reliable and high-speed connectivity in a country where internet access has historically been unstable. Starlink's growth trajectory suggests it could soon overtake competitors to become Nigeria's top ISP, despite its premium pricing of 38,000 naira (about $24) per month, which is significantly higher than local alternatives.<br><br>Source: Rest of World<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250416/p10#a250416p10

            Chinese venture capital funding for AI and machine learning dropped 30 percent year-over-year to 1.2 billion dollars in the first quarter, according to PitchBook data. Experts indicate that Chinese investors have become hesitant to back startups developing foundation models, instead favoring companies building practical AI applications. This strategic pivot reflects both market saturation and regulatory concerns in China's AI landscape.

            Bots now account for the majority of internet traffic, with malicious bots increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to become more sophisticated and harder to detect. According to Imperva's 2025 Bad Bot Report, these AI-enhanced bots can now mimic human behavior with unprecedented accuracy, enabling more effective credential stuffing attacks, account takeovers, and web scraping operations. Advanced bots can solve CAPTCHAs, bypass traditional security measures, and execute complex attack patterns that adapt to defensive strategies. Security experts recommend implementing AI-powered countermeasures that can analyze behavioral patterns and intent to distinguish between legitimate users and sophisticated bots.<br><br>Source: news.google.com https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNV19hZWkxUVg3ejBWSTEyU0M4eDFTNTIxQ2FnOVNUc09DM2tvX1NFS1cxdUxXU3U2VktnRTNtTDJ0eE8yYlNUMlFpSk1qUTJyalRkSHI0Qnpsa1JaVV9QZFdzQ2JhYURWTzVWMTJSS014cElnYllRbW0yZVBGYmE1ZDZ5OTB6NlVhZjlv?oc=5

            Artificial intelligence technologies are demonstrating significant potential in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning, though implementation challenges remain substantial. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images with high accuracy, potentially detecting cancerous lesions earlier than traditional methods and helping clinicians develop more personalized treatment plans. However, researchers caution that AI systems trained on non-diverse datasets may perpetuate or amplify existing healthcare disparities, particularly affecting underrepresented populations. Healthcare institutions implementing these technologies face additional hurdles including integration with existing systems, staff training requirements, and questions about data privacy and security.<br><br>Source: Cancer Network https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQNklzYzZCXzhoeC1JREV1eGkwZHdXWXNrZjYzLWtHaE9PMnU5STFxZG5wS3d3eld2X2VraUZKR2tfNjliQjhmM3ZGRTRtekJZX2drTWVQN3ZiUlF6djd6RmRnckItZ2xBeVdBUzVwQlVIYnpfeTNRSVRaTHhQYnE1Q0RLNTB0dlVtWkRfQU0yTEd2QzdZVzZkcGhpeHMtVlZfcDMzcmVmRVFGQlVGVm9wQlRPMA?oc=5

            OpenAI introduced a new family of models called GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano, all featuring a 1-million-token context window capable of processing approximately 750,000 words at once. The models excel at coding and instruction following but are only available through OpenAI's API, not ChatGPT. While GPT-4.1 scored between 52 percent and 54.6 percent on SWE-bench Verified, slightly below competitors like Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro (63.8 percent) and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet (62.3 percent), OpenAI claims it achieved 72 percent accuracy on video understanding tests. Pricing ranges from $2 per million input tokens and $8 per million output tokens for the full GPT-4.1 model to just $0.10 per million input tokens and $0.40 per million output tokens for the nano version.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com http://www.techmeme.com/250415/p2#a250415p2
