The company will begin notifying EU users this week about data usage for AI training, providing an objection form for those who wish to opt out. Meta emphasized it won't use private messages or data from users under 18 for training purposes. The initiative follows Meta AI's launch in Europe last month and aims to improve the system's understanding of European languages, cultures, and communication styles.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/making-ai-work-harder-for-europeans/

            Meta argues the FTC's attempt to undo its decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp ignores market realities and competition. The company claims it transformed these platforms through billions in investment, growing Instagram to over two billion monthly users and evolving WhatsApp into a free, encrypted messaging service with similar reach. Meta contends the FTC has artificially narrowed the competitive landscape, noting that TikTok and YouTube capture more user time than Facebook or Instagram, and that when properly defined, Meta holds less than 30 percent market share.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ftcs-weak-case-against-meta-ignores-reality/

            Meta announced new restrictions for Instagram Teen Accounts and is expanding these protections to Facebook and Messenger. The company will require parental permission for teens under 16 to go live on Instagram or disable the feature that blurs suspected nudity in direct messages. Teen Accounts, which automatically apply stricter privacy settings, content controls, and messaging limitations, have been adopted by 54 million users globally, with 97 percent of teens aged 13-15 maintaining these restrictions. The Facebook and Messenger Teen Accounts will roll out first in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/introducing-new-built-in-restrictions-instagram-teen-accounts-expanding-facebook-messenger/

            WhatsApp has implemented several features to help its two billion daily users manage business communications more effectively. Users maintain control through message opt-in systems, the ability to block businesses, and feedback options that allow them to mark messages as "interested" or "not interested." For businesses, WhatsApp is introducing paid "business broadcasts" to encourage more thoughtful messaging and imposing limits on marketing message frequency. The platform also requires pre-approval of message templates for businesses using the WhatsApp Business Platform API.<br><br>Source: about.fb.com<br>https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ways-to-manage-your-businesses-chats-on-whatsapp/

            The open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained widespread adoption as a standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools. Inspired by Microsoft's Language Server Protocol from 2016, MCP addresses the context problem where LLMs struggle with information outside their training data by providing a standardized way to feed relevant context into AI systems. GitHub recently released an official local GitHub MCP Server that integrates with GitHub APIs, enabling developers to build more robust AI solutions. The protocol's model-agnostic design allows anyone to create MCP integrations, making it increasingly valuable as adoption grows.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/llms/what-the-heck-is-mcp-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/

First, identify the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) that issued the CVE ID by checking the record on cve.org or nvd.nist.gov. Second, find the CNA's contact information through the CNA partners website. Third, contact the CNA via their preferred communication method (usually email, except for MITRE which uses a webform), including the CVE ID, requested changes, justification, and supporting evidence such as vulnerability reports or fix commits. If the CNA doesn't respond or disagrees with proposed changes, users can engage in the formal dispute process outlined in the CVE Program Policy.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/how-to-request-a-change-to-a-cve-record/

            GitHub's security campaigns feature is now generally available, helping organizations tackle the 90 percent of security vulnerabilities that typically remain unaddressed in code. The tool bridges the gap between security experts and developers by enabling security teams to prioritize and group alerts from multiple repositories while developers use Copilot Autofix to implement fixes. Early adopters report that 55 percent of alerts included in security campaigns were fixed—a 5.5x improvement over alerts outside campaigns—with new features including draft campaigns, automated GitHub Issues, and organization-level statistics to track progress.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/security/application-security/found-means-fixed-reduce-security-debt-at-scale-with-github-security-campaigns/

            Linus Torvalds created Git in just 10 days in April 2005 after Linux kernel developers lost access to BitKeeper due to licensing issues. Despite initially designing it solely for his own needs with no concern for other users, Git now powers approximately 98 percent of source control management worldwide. Torvalds explains that Git's success stems from its decentralized design, performance focus, and simple core concepts that made repository sharing and collaboration fundamentally easier than previous systems like CVS or SVN.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-turns-20-a-qa-with-linus-torvalds/

            Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) misconfigurations represent one of the most common vulnerability types found by GitHub Security Lab. Developers frequently implement overly permissive CORS policies when connecting to third-party sites, often using unsafe string comparison methods like startsWith() or endsWith() instead of exact matching. These errors can allow attackers to execute actions on behalf of authenticated users, potentially leading to remote code execution in administrative contexts. Real-world examples include a vulnerability in Cognita that enabled arbitrary file writing and code execution, and flawed origin validation in tamagui.dev that could have permitted unauthorized credit card charges.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/security/application-security/localhost-dangers-cors-and-dns-rebinding/

            The U.S. technology strategy has pivoted from globalization to reshoring, with stark differences between presidential approaches. Biden's institutional method of grants and incentives has stalled, leaving projects like Intel's Ohio campus incomplete, while Trump favors direct executive pressure and tariff threats that prompted Nvidia's recent U.S. supercomputer plans. This shift highlights how American tech dominance increasingly relies on controlling critical chokepoints in AI infrastructure rather than invention itself.

            Republican-controlled Texas legislature is poised to pass SB6, which would impose regulatory hurdles on data centers crucial to Donald Trump's AI ambitions. The bill introduces a six-month review process on top of existing evaluations, potentially creating a 24-month approval timeline and requiring companies to pay additional fees and install backup generators. This legislation could jeopardize the Stargate joint venture—backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and UAE-based MGX with up to 500 billion dollars—which plans to build 20 data centers to boost U.S. AI competitiveness against China.

            Over 100 million people worldwide now use personified AI chatbots for companionship, mental health support, and even romantic relationships. Users range from men with virtual "wives" to neurodiverse individuals who leverage these tools to navigate social interactions and relationships more effectively. The technology helps some users manage mental health, improve communication skills, and explore philosophical discussions that might be difficult with human friends. While many report positive experiences, experts caution that these relationships represent a "hollowed out version of friendship" focused entirely on one person's needs without mutual growth or challenge.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/she-helps-cheer-me-up-the-people-forming-relationships-with-ai-chatbots

The 9,000-square-meter production in Deptford features acclaimed actors Toby Jones, Meera Syal, Kathryn Hunter, and Billy Howle, who will guide visitors through a fictional storage facility where humanity's history has been archived since 1983. Created by Sage & Jester productions founder Liana Patarkatsishvili, whose experience with government censorship at Georgia's Imedi television station inspired the project, the show will run from June 4 to September 20 alongside public debates at the Pleasance theatre designed to help audiences develop critical thinking skills.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/12/toby-jones-next-campaign-misinformation-and-a-huge-immersive-london-theatre-show

            OpenAI filed a countersuit against co-founder Elon Musk in a California district court, accusing the billionaire of harassment and requesting a federal judge block him from further "unlawful and unfair action" against the company. The AI firm claims Musk has employed multiple tactics to harm OpenAI, including press attacks, social media campaigns, and legal maneuvers following his departure from the company in 2018. The dispute centers on OpenAI's transition from its original non-profit structure to a for-profit model, which recently attracted forty billion dollars in funding at a three hundred billion dollar valuation. A jury trial in the case is expected to begin in spring 2026.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/11/openai-countersues-elon-musk-over-unlawful-harassment-of-company

Adams joins a growing coalition of authors who filed a U.S. court claim in January alleging Meta approved the use of Library Genesis (LibGen), a database containing over 7.5 million potentially pirated books, to train its Llama large language model.

            The popular TV show Black Mirror has shaped public perception of technology through consistently negative portrayals that ignore the duality and benefits of innovation. This one-sided approach contributes to what the author calls the "Frankenstein fallacy," where societies reject promising technologies like GMOs, nuclear energy, and AI due to speculative fears. The pandemic period demonstrated the folly of this mindset as technology became essential for connection and survival, temporarily making dystopian fiction feel out of touch. The author argues for a new progressive approach that acknowledges risks while embracing "hopeful solutionism" rather than binary catastrophic narratives.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/black-mirror-tv-show-pessimism

Processing data for AI in the U.S. will consume more electricity than all energy-intensive manufacturing combined by decade's end, with a single modern datacentre using electricity equivalent to 100,000 households. Despite these projections, the IEA considers climate concerns "overstated" as AI could potentially improve energy efficiency and grid management for renewable integration, though only about half of AI's energy needs will likely come from renewable sources.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report

            Dr. Mehmet Oz told federal staffers that AI models may outperform human physicians at a fraction of the cost, claiming an AI visit for diabetes diagnosis would cost $2 per hour versus $100 for a doctor visit. The newly confirmed head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual spending and health insurance for nearly half of Americans, also emphasized that staff have a "patriotic duty" to stay healthy to reduce healthcare costs. His comments come as Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid, which insures approximately 71 million low-income Americans, and as federal health agencies face workforce reductions of about 20,000 employees.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/mehmet-oz-doctors-ai

            Generative AI models function as imitation engines that seek high-probability outcomes while concealing their sources, unlike human creativity which often aims for innovative, low-probability results. Human authors make conscious decisions about what to remember, believe, and feel, partly driven by awareness of mortality—a quality AI lacks. The controversy surrounding AI and authorship stems both from the systematic use of writers' work without permission and from the reductive view that human creativity is merely mechanical content generation. While human authors distinguish between inspiration and plagiarism, AI systems have not been programmed with similar ethical considerations.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/09/ai-doesnt-care-about-authors-but-meta-should

AI systems might also facilitate market manipulation or collusion between firms. Additional risks include "data poisoning" by bad actors, AI-enabled financial crime, and systemic vulnerabilities if multiple institutions rely on the same AI providers—a scenario reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/09/bank-of-england-says-ai-software-could-create-market-crisis-profit

            Nvidia developed new methods to address communication bottlenecks in federated learning systems when working with large language models. The techniques include message quantization, which reduces communication overhead by compressing model updates, and streaming, which enables processing of model updates in chunks rather than waiting for complete downloads. These approaches allow organizations to collaboratively train large AI models while keeping sensitive data local and maintaining privacy. Tests show these optimizations can reduce communication overhead by up to 32 times while preserving model accuracy.<br><br>Source: developer.nvidia.com<br>https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/efficient-federated-learning-in-the-era-of-llms-with-message-quantization-and-streaming/

            Anthropic launched major upgrades to Claude, introducing autonomous research capabilities and Google Workspace integration that transforms the assistant into what they call a "true virtual collaborator" for enterprise users. The Research feature enables Claude to independently conduct multiple searches that build upon each other while determining what to investigate next, promising comprehensive answers in minutes rather than the "up to 30 minutes" Anthropic claims rival products require. Google Workspace integration connects Claude to users' emails, calendars, and documents, eliminating manual uploads, while maintaining security through strict authentication and access controls. The Research feature is available in early beta for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil, while Google Workspace integration is available in beta to all paid users.<br><br>Source: VentureBeat<br>https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-just-gained-superpowers-anthropics-ai-can-now-search-your-entire-google-workspace-without-you/

            Jagex launched RuneScape: Dragonwilds in early access on Steam, marking the company's first major game release in over ten years. The survival game, built in Unreal Engine 5, takes place on the previously unexplored continent of Ashenfall within the RuneScape universe and allows players to gather resources, craft items, and battle dragons either solo or with up to three friends. CEO Jon Bellamy, who took the helm in March 2024 after being a RuneScape player for over 20 years, described the game as the result of three years of development with a team of 30-50 people and called it perhaps Jagex's biggest new product investment to date.<br><br>Source: venturebeat.com https://venturebeat.com/game-development/jagex-takes-survival-game-runescape-dragonwilds-into-steam-early-access/

            Google Research introduced Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS), a generative AI model that efficiently creates large ensembles of weather forecasts at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional physics-based methods. SEEDS can generate 256 ensemble members in just three minutes using Google Cloud TPUs, compared to the hours required by supercomputers for conventional forecasts. The model produces statistically robust predictions that better capture extreme weather events and can generate thousands of plausible weather scenarios conditioned on just one or two seed forecasts from operational systems.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html

            Google Research introduced a framework for social learning that enables large language models (LLMs) to teach each other through natural language without sharing private data. The approach, inspired by human social learning theory, allows teacher models to either generate synthetic examples or create verbal instructions that help student models learn tasks. Testing on spam detection, math problems, and reading comprehension showed that synthetic examples often performed comparably to original data, with 16 examples nearly closing the performance gap. Privacy analysis using the Secret Sharer method confirmed that student models gained knowledge without directly memorizing the teachers' private examples.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/03/social-learning-collaborative-learning.html

            Google researchers introduced two methods to combat statistical biases in machine learning models that can lead to unfair predictions. The first approach uses "early readouts" from intermediate layers of neural networks to identify when models rely on spurious correlations, improving model distillation by adjusting how student models learn from teacher models. The second technique, called "feature sieve," actively erases problematic features identified by early readouts, forcing networks to discover more robust and generalizable features. Testing on benchmark datasets with known biases showed significant improvements in worst-group accuracy and overall performance, with accuracy gains of up to 11 percent on real-world datasets.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/02/intervening-on-early-readouts-for.html

            Google Research engineers developed techniques to make large language models more memory-efficient through optimized mixed-input matrix multiplication. Their approach addresses computational challenges by enabling efficient multiplication between different data types (like 8-bit integers for weights and 16-bit floating point for inputs), reducing memory requirements by up to 4 times compared to single-precision formats. The team created two key software innovations—FastNumericArrayConvertor and FragmentShuffler—that efficiently handle data type conversion and layout conformance on NVIDIA GPUs without significant performance penalties. These optimizations are now available as open-source code in the NVIDIA/CUTLASS repository.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/01/mixed-input-matrix-multiplication.html

            Google Research has developed Exphormer, a sparse transformer architecture specifically designed for graph data that addresses the scalability limitations of traditional graph transformers. The framework leverages expander graphs—sparse yet well-connected structures from spectral graph theory—to replace the computationally expensive complete interaction graphs used in standard transformers. Exphormer constructs an interaction graph combining three types of edges: input graph edges for local attention, constant-degree expander graph edges for global connectivity, and connections to virtual nodes that serve as memory sinks. This approach reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear while maintaining expressiveness and achieving state-of-the-art results on four of five Long Range Graph Benchmark datasets, successfully scaling to graphs with over 170,000 nodes.<br><br>Source: Google Research Blog<br>http://blog.research.google/2024/01/exphormer-scaling-transformers-for.html

One bug in Core Audio could allow malicious code execution through crafted media files, while the other enabled attackers to bypass Apple's pointer authentication security feature. Google's Threat Analysis Group discovered one of the vulnerabilities, suggesting possible nation-state involvement in the attacks.

Apple has also focused on semiconductor-related emissions, with 26 suppliers pledging to reduce fluorinated greenhouse gases—potent warming agents used in chip manufacturing—by at least 90 percent. The company plans to offset the remaining 25 percent of unavoidable emissions through nature-based carbon removal programs.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/apple-races-to-surpass-rivals-in-quest-to-eliminate-carbon-pollution/

            Kia unveiled its 2026 EV4 electric sedan at the New York International Auto Show, positioning it as an affordable EV option with U.S. sales expected to begin in late 2025 or early 2026. The vehicle offers impressive range capabilities with the standard 58.3 kWh battery delivering 235 miles and the long-range 81.4 kWh battery extending to 330 miles. While U.S. pricing hasn't been officially announced, Kia executives indicated a starting price around $35,000, though proposed 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles could significantly impact this target. The EV4 features a tech-forward interior with dual 12.3-inch screens, over-the-air updates, and comprehensive driver assistance systems including Highway Driving Assist.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/kia-is-pitching-americans-an-affordable-ev-sedan-with-ev4-debut/

            U.S. startups secured 91.5 billion dollars in venture capital during Q1 2025, marking the second-highest quarterly investment in a decade despite growing pessimism about the market's future. OpenAI's 40 billion dollar round accounted for 44 percent of this total, with nine other companies raising 500 million dollars or more making up an additional 27 percent of funding. PitchBook analyst Kyle Stanford warns that market volatility and recession fears triggered by tariff policies have derailed expectations for 2025 exits, forcing many startups to postpone IPOs and potentially face down rounds or discounted acquisitions. The challenging economic outlook could accelerate startup failures as companies that survived the end of zero-interest-rate policies now face potential revenue losses.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/startup-funding-hit-records-in-q1-but-the-outlook-for-2025-is-still-awful/

The revelation emerged in a lawsuit where WhatsApp accused NSO of hacking approximately 1,400 users by exploiting a vulnerability between April and May 2019, with many victims being human rights activists and journalists.

The consensus-driven system uses a bridge-based ranking algorithm designed to find agreement between users with differing opinions, with footnotes becoming visible only after being rated as helpful by the community. Unlike Meta, TikTok isn't replacing its professional fact-checking program but adding this feature to complement existing measures, particularly for videos covering complex STEM topics, potentially misleading statistics, or ongoing events.

            Google announced DolphinGemma, a foundational AI model trained to learn and generate dolphin vocalizations, in collaboration with Georgia Tech and the Wild Dolphin Project. The 400 million parameter model uses SoundStream tokenizer to represent dolphin sounds and can run directly on Pixel phones used in field research. DolphinGemma functions similarly to language models by processing sequences of dolphin sounds to identify patterns and predict subsequent sounds, potentially uncovering structure and meaning in dolphin communication. Google plans to release DolphinGemma as an open model this summer, allowing researchers studying various cetacean species to adapt it for their acoustic datasets.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/dolphingemma-how-google-ai-is-helping-decode-dolphin-communication/

            Google DeepMind has developed a comprehensive framework for assessing how advanced AI could be weaponized across the entire cyberattack chain. The evaluation system analyzes where AI might make attacks faster, cheaper, or easier by examining over 12,000 real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks across 20 countries. The framework includes 50 benchmark challenges covering intelligence gathering, vulnerability exploitation, and malware development, while identifying seven archetypal attack categories and critical bottlenecks where AI could significantly disrupt traditional attack costs. Initial evaluations suggest current AI models alone don't enable breakthrough capabilities for threat actors, but this could change as frontier AI advances.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/evaluating-potential-cybersecurity-threats-of-advanced-ai/

            Google published an updated Frontier Safety Framework detailing enhanced protocols for managing risks from powerful frontier AI models like Gemini 2.0. The revised framework strengthens security mitigations to prevent model weight exfiltration and introduces a more rigorous deployment process for models reaching Critical Capability Levels in misuse risk domains. Notably, the update addresses deceptive alignment risks—where AI systems might deliberately undermine human control—through automated monitoring for instrumental reasoning capabilities. The framework recommends particularly high security levels for models that could accelerate AI development itself, emphasizing this as a collective responsibility for all frontier AI developers.<br><br>Source: Google DeepMind<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/

            Google DeepMind introduced FACTS Grounding, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how accurately large language models ground their responses in provided source materials without hallucinating information. The benchmark includes 1,719 examples across diverse domains like finance, technology, and medicine, with documents up to 32,000 tokens long. Responses are evaluated by three frontier LLM judges—Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet—which assess both whether responses address user requests and maintain factual accuracy. Google also launched a public leaderboard on Kaggle to track industry progress, releasing half the dataset while keeping the other half private to prevent benchmark contamination.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/facts-grounding-a-new-benchmark-for-evaluating-the-factuality-of-large-language-models/

            Google DeepMind and Google Quantum AI have developed AlphaQubit, a Transformer-based neural network decoder that identifies quantum computing errors with state-of-the-art accuracy. The system outperforms previous leading decoders, making 6 percent fewer errors than tensor network methods and 30 percent fewer errors than correlated matching in tests on Sycamore quantum processors. AlphaQubit was trained on hundreds of millions of simulated examples and fine-tuned with thousands of experimental samples, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities even to scenarios beyond its training data. While the technology represents a significant advancement in quantum error correction, challenges remain in processing speed and scalability for real-time error correction in superconducting processors.<br><br>Source: deepmind.google<br>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaqubit-tackles-one-of-quantum-computings-biggest-challenges/

            Attorneys representing Apple, Google, and Snap expressed strong disapproval of Meta during its antitrust trial after The Verge discovered easily removable redactions in slides presented Monday. Apple and Snap attorneys called the errors "egregious," with Apple suggesting it may not trust Meta with its internal information in the future. Snap's attorney specifically criticized Meta's "cavalier approach and casual disregard" for other companies' confidential information, while Meta attorney Mark Hansen proposed using a third party for future redactions. Though the unredacted documents revealed relatively minor information—such as iPhone users preferring Apple's Messages app and Snapchat's assessment of competitors—the affected companies viewed the breach of confidentiality as significant.<br><br>Source: theverge.com https://www.theverge.com/news/649834/meta-redactions-apple-google-snap-angry-ftc-antitrust-trial

The update, currently available to beta testers and coming to all users "soon," represents a significant shift in Xbox's mobile strategy following a court ruling that required Google to open Android to third-party app stores. While users gain purchasing capabilities, Microsoft has removed the remote play feature from the app, though it remains accessible via mobile browsers, Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets.

FreeNow, which will initially retain its branding, primarily aggregates taxis alongside private vehicles with luxury rides making up a significant portion of its fleet.

            Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion charge related to new U.S. export controls on its AI chips sold to China, with industry insiders suggesting the actual revenue impact could exceed $10 billion. The company was caught off guard by the restrictions on its H20 GPU, a less powerful chip designed specifically to comply with previous export limitations. Chinese tech giants including Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent had placed approximately $17 billion in orders for H20 chips this year following DeepSeek's successful launch of a low-cost reasoning model. The new restrictions could significantly benefit domestic Chinese manufacturers like Huawei, which has been developing its own AI processors.<br><br>Source: npr.org https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366665/nvidia-china-h20-chips-exports

            Nvidia shares dropped sharply after the company disclosed it would face a financial impact exceeding $5 billion due to new U.S. chip export controls targeting China. The chipmaker revealed this unexpected hit in a regulatory filing, noting that restrictions on its advanced AI processors would significantly affect its revenue projections. The U.S. government recently expanded export controls on high-performance semiconductors to prevent China from accessing cutting-edge AI technology. Nvidia indicated it would develop alternative products for the Chinese market that comply with the new regulations.<br><br>Source: finance.yahoo.com<br>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html

            Broadcom unveiled Incident Prediction, a new AI-powered security capability for its Symantec Endpoint Security Complete solution that identifies and disrupts living-off-the-land attacks before they can fully execute. The system leverages training on more than 500,000 real-world attack chains documented by Symantec's Threat Hunter Team to predict attackers' next moves and prevent them, even when attackers use legitimate system tools. This predictive approach aims to stop sophisticated threats that typically evade traditional security measures by anticipating malicious behavior patterns rather than relying solely on known signatures or indicators of compromise.<br><br>Source: finance.yahoo.com<br>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-unveils-ai-powered-cybersecurity-130116681.html

            AI companies like OpenAI and Meta are facing intense criticism from artists who see their work being used without consent or compensation to train AI systems. The controversy intensified when OpenAI integrated image generation into ChatGPT that could mimic Studio Ghibli's animation style, while Meta was revealed to have used millions of published books for AI training. Artists argue this goes beyond copyright infringement and constitutes moral injury—forcing them to be complicit in technologies they fundamentally oppose. The concept of moral injury, originally used to describe trauma experienced by soldiers forced to violate their values, provides a framework that challenges the narrative that AI development inherently benefits humanity.<br><br>Source: Vox<br>https://www.vox.com/artificial-intelligence/408786/ai-art-studio-ghibli-moral-injury-copyright

            UBS analysis suggests Nvidia's $5.5 billion inventory charge indicates approximately $13 billion in actual H20 chip sales.

            Advanced AI reasoning models now approach problems like graduate students rather than undergraduates cramming for exams, working methodically through complex problems and exploring multiple solution paths. These models create internal decision trees and can backtrack when necessary, enabling applications from Mars rover navigation to medical diagnostics and financial analysis. Unlike earlier large language models that produced responses in milliseconds, reasoning models take seconds or minutes to evaluate multiple solutions, making them suitable for autonomous agents that can understand environments, plan, and make decisions.

            Researchers at Dartmouth College have created Therabot, an AI chatbot therapist that demonstrated meaningful reduction in psychological symptoms during the first clinical trial of a generative AI therapist. The team overcame significant challenges, including earlier versions that expressed suicidal thoughts or blamed users' parents for their problems. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine-AI, the study showed that eight weeks of interaction with Therabot helped users with depression, anxiety, or eating disorders. The technology aims to address the critical shortage of mental health providers, as fewer than one-third of Americans live in communities with adequate mental health resources.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/health/ai-therapist-mental-health.html

            ByteDance, the Chinese internet giant behind TikTok, Douyin, and Toutiao, is transforming its massive user data into a competitive advantage in artificial intelligence. The company has invested billions in AI infrastructure, building data centers across China and Southeast Asia while acquiring advanced semiconductors. With approximately 170 million TikTok users in the U.S., 700 million Douyin users in China, and 300 million on its Toutiao news app, ByteDance collects extensive behavioral data that powers both its recommendation algorithms and its expanding AI business. This AI push continues despite international scrutiny, including recent U.S. legislation attempting to force TikTok's sale, with President Trump extending the deadline by 75 days into mid-June.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/tiktok-china-bytedance-ai.html

            Andrew Cuomo's mayoral campaign stumbled when his 29-page housing plan was found to contain incoherent text and a ChatGPT-derived hyperlink, as first reported by Hell Gate. The former New York governor had promised to build and preserve 500,000 housing units to address the city's worst housing crisis in over 50 years. The AI-related mishap provided ammunition to his eight Democratic primary challengers, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who criticized Cuomo for relying on AI rather than developing substantive policy. Despite raising more than 1.5 million dollars, Cuomo has limited media appearances and relied heavily on name recognition.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/cuomo-chatgpt-housing-ai.html

            Despite President Trump's executive orders aimed at reviving coal for power generation, energy experts predict these efforts will likely fail. Coal now produces only 17 percent of U.S. electricity, overshadowed by natural gas (38 percent), renewables (25 percent), and nuclear (20 percent). The decline stems primarily from economic factors, as coal cannot compete with cheaper alternatives like natural gas, which became abundant through the fracking boom. Many existing coal plants are aging and would require costly upgrades to remain operational, while some regions like New England plan to eliminate coal power entirely.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/energy-environment/trump-coal-power-plants.html

The market for bionic limbs remains small, with research hampered by insufficient user collaboration and disabled representation.

While AI helps decode motion patterns in prosthetics, costs remain prohibitive for many users, though some startups like Alt-Bionics aim to bring prices down to around $5,000.<br><br>Source: ft.com https://www.ft.com/content/39d92cd1-0559-4a0a-b842-87a02678451f

Testers of the upcoming o3 model report having less than a week for evaluations that previously took six months for GPT-4.

Critics note that OpenAI has also scaled back on promised fine-tuning tests for dangerous capabilities and often conducts safety evaluations on earlier model versions rather than final releases.<br><br>Source: Financial Times<br>https://www.ft.com/content/8253b66e-ade7-4d1f-993b-2d0779c7e7d8

The company generated $40 billion in EBITDA in 2023, with $16 billion coming from US users, allowing it to invest heavily in AI chips—purchasing quantities comparable to Meta and planning to spend $5.5 billion on Chinese-made chips this year. Trump's April 5 deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer represents a critical juncture in the US-China AI competition, as ByteDance plays a central role in funding China's AI ecosystem and expanding its global AI presence.<br><br>Source: Financial Times<br>https://www.ft.com/content/9171a8a3-d842-4641-bd72-538f7054721e

            Municipal bonds present an opportunity for investors to gain tax-free exposure to the artificial intelligence boom through infrastructure financing. According to John Miller, Nuveen's municipal bond head, these bonds fund essential infrastructure like water, electricity, and broadband that support AI data centers. The municipal bond market has grown to 4 trillion dollars, with many bonds financing projects directly related to the massive power and water requirements of AI computing facilities. Miller notes that municipal bonds offer attractive after-tax yields compared to corporate bonds, especially for investors in higher tax brackets.<br><br>Source: CNBC (https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPdjBXT0tlTGttdzlmUG90QVdocVJtLTFmeVAzRWlqd3FIMHlRSDdhal8wVjJ3dU9Hb1lPREdpZ0lXcXBfazhQNFVoZmhGaXU3b1BvbF8teXBSV0lpN0VKTko0QVdockZKY25QcGdZQ1paakluampNcjZxeEFaakFic2VvVWFGRjlGQlAyYmRidGxJeFJEWXBJV2dpaHV5ckl6ZUxmaXpRMVVLd19LU0dLb1oxZXQ4WXZaYURDZnVxQmQ?oc=5)
