            GitHub Actions offers two runner options for CI/CD workflows: fully managed GitHub-hosted runners and self-managed runners on your infrastructure. GitHub-hosted runners provide 99.9 percent availability, built-in security with zero-trust architecture, and 24/7 support without requiring infrastructure management. Self-hosted runners offer more control for specialized requirements but demand expertise in infrastructure, security, and scaling, particularly when using Actions Runner Controller (ARC) with Kubernetes. For most organizations, GitHub-hosted runners deliver better value through pay-as-you-go pricing without network egress fees, unlimited Docker Hub pulls, and included maintenance.<br><br>Source: The GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/when-to-choose-github-hosted-runners-or-self-hosted-runners-with-github-actions/

            GitHub launched sub-issues, a new feature that enables users to break larger issues into smaller, hierarchical tasks within a single issue. The feature creates a nested structure that helps teams track progress, manage dependencies, and maintain organization across complex projects. GitHub built sub-issues using a straightforward MySQL relationship model and exposed them through GraphQL endpoints, leveraging existing React components and new list-view elements. The development team practiced "dogfooding" by using sub-issues to build the feature itself, which helped identify improvements like adding issue numbers and repository names to sub-issue displays.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/introducing-sub-issues-enhancing-issue-management-on-github/

            The open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained widespread adoption as a standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools. Inspired by Microsoft's Language Server Protocol from 2016, MCP addresses the context problem where LLMs struggle with information outside their training data by providing a standardized way to feed relevant context into AI systems. GitHub recently released an official local GitHub MCP Server that integrates with GitHub APIs, enabling developers to build more robust AI solutions. The protocol's model-agnostic design allows anyone to create MCP integrations, making it increasingly valuable as adoption grows.<br><br>Source: github.blog<br>https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/llms/what-the-heck-is-mcp-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/

            GitHub's suite of security tools aims to make secure coding less painful by integrating directly into developer workflows rather than requiring context switching. Secret Protection catches API keys and credentials before they're committed, detecting over 39 million secret leaks in 2024. Dependabot automatically identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and creates pull requests with fixes, now featuring Exploit Prediction Scoring System data to help prioritize high-risk issues. Code Security with CodeQL analyzes code for vulnerabilities, while Copilot Autofix automatically generates fixes for 90 percent of alert types in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python, reducing remediation time by up to 60 percent.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/security/application-security/how-were-making-security-easier-for-the-average-developer/

            The process for updating Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records requires contacting the specific CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) that issued the vulnerability ID. The three-step process involves first identifying the issuing CNA from the CVE record on cve.org or nvd.nist.gov, then finding their contact information on the CNA partners website, and finally reaching out with specific details including the CVE ID, requested changes, justification, and supporting evidence. While most CNAs prefer email communication, MITRE Corporation uses a webform for CVE-related requests, and response times vary across organizations.<br><br>Source: GitHub Blog<br>https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/how-to-request-a-change-to-a-cve-record/

            Advanced AI reasoning models now approach problems like graduate students rather than undergraduates cramming for exams, working methodically through complex problems and exploring multiple solution paths. These models create internal decision trees and can backtrack when necessary, enabling applications from Mars rover navigation to medical diagnostics and financial analysis. Unlike earlier large language models that produced responses in milliseconds, reasoning models take seconds or minutes to evaluate multiple solutions, making them suitable for autonomous agents that can understand environments, plan, and make decisions. This evolution requires significantly more computational resources, with Microsoft and NVIDIA collaborating on infrastructure solutions that can handle the varying inference durations and reliability challenges across all system levels.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115033/adapting-for-ais-reasoning-era/

The Texas startup, which has raised over 400 million dollars, aims to establish legal control over its genetically modified animals, including recently unveiled dire wolf-inspired canids. The patent application covers not just specific methods but the modified animals themselves, claiming rights to creatures with mammoth gene variants affecting hair, body size, cold tolerance, and cognitive capacity.

            Vibe coding, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy, describes a coding approach where developers fully trust AI assistants to generate and fix code with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI-assisted coding, vibe coding involves interacting with codebases primarily through prompts and accepting AI suggestions without manually checking or tweaking the code. While this approach works well for simple projects like prototypes or small web apps, experts warn against using it for complex systems requiring security measures or handling sensitive data, as AI-generated code often contains errors.<br><br>Source: MIT Technology Review<br>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115135/what-is-vibe-coding-exactly/

Working with her son Arnar Skarphéðinsson, she has identified three potential techniques: drilling into magma pockets, channeling lava into pre-dug trenches to form foundations, or 3D-printing bricks from molten lava. The concept leverages Iceland's 30 active volcanoes and addresses the construction industry's massive carbon footprint, which currently contributes 37 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions.

            The U.S. technology strategy has pivoted from globalization to reshoring, with stark differences between presidential approaches. Biden's institutional method of grants and incentives has stalled, leaving projects like Intel's Ohio campus incomplete, while Trump favors direct executive pressure and tariff threats that prompted Nvidia's recent U.S. supercomputer plans. This shift highlights how American tech dominance increasingly relies on controlling critical chokepoints in AI infrastructure rather than invention itself. The emerging industrial policy now operates more through presidential demands than structured policy frameworks, raising concerns as the U.S. faces potential international backlash over changing trade relationships.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-industrial-policy-inward-turn-by-ultimatum

            David Salle, a prominent postmodern painter, has developed a custom AI model trained specifically on his own artistic style and approach. Salle worked with technologists to create an AI system that functions as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement, describing the process as similar to training "a kid in art school." The system helps Salle expand upon his existing compositions and explore new variations of his work, while maintaining his distinctive visual language. The artist views this technological integration as an evolution of his practice rather than a threat to traditional artmaking.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/15/david-salle-ai-art-school-postmodern-master

            Nvidia announced plans to build up to $500 billion worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States over the next four years. The massive investment comes as Donald Trump reiterated threats to impose tariffs on semiconductors manufactured abroad, particularly those Nvidia produces in Taiwan. The timing of the announcement follows a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month. This strategic move represents one of the largest domestic AI infrastructure commitments to date and signals how chip manufacturers are responding to potential trade restrictions.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/nvidia-to-build-500bn-of-us-ai-infrastructure-as-chip-tariff-looms

            British AI startup Synthesia has secured a licensing agreement with Shutterstock to use its corporate video footage library for training its latest AI model. The $2 billion company, which specializes in generating realistic digital avatars, aims to improve the expressiveness, vocal tones, and body language of its AI-generated characters through this partnership. Synthesia will pay Shutterstock an undisclosed amount for access to this training data, which the company believes will lead to more human-like performances from its avatars.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/ai-avatar-generator-synthesia-video-footage-shutterstock

            Black Mirror has evolved beyond science fiction to become a form of "science folklore" that significantly influences public attitudes toward technology. The show assigns negative allegories to innovations—depicting smartphones as tools of social stratification, robot dogs as predatory hunters, and AI as a form of necromancy—effectively channeling and amplifying collective anxieties about technological advancement. While the series earns praise for its masterful production, questions arise about whether its consistently pessimistic framing of technology deserves the outsized influence it holds over cultural discourse around innovation.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/black-mirror-tv-show-pessimism

            Generative AI models function as imitation engines that seek high-probability outcomes while concealing their sources, unlike human creativity which often pursues innovative, low-probability results. Human authors make conscious decisions about what to remember, believe, and feel, with creativity partly driven by mortality awareness—something AI lacks entirely. The controversy surrounding AI training involves both the unauthorized use of creative works and the reductive assumption that human authors are merely content-generating machines. Unlike human creators who distinguish between inspiration and plagiarism, AI systems have not been programmed with similar ethical considerations.<br><br>Source: The Guardian<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/09/ai-doesnt-care-about-authors-but-meta-should

            Nvidia stock fell 7.4 percent in morning trading after the company revealed it may be unable to sell certain high-end chips, including H20 models, to China due to Trump administration export controls. The company received an export restriction notice on April 9, 2025, suggesting this development was unexpected and likely not factored into Nvidia's near-term sales projections. This restriction could significantly impact Nvidia's revenue stream in the Chinese market, which has been an important growth area for the GPU manufacturer amid the global AI hardware boom.<br><br>Source: finance.yahoo.com<br>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nvidia-nvda-stock-down-160330625.html

            Nvidia shares dropped over eight percent after the U.S. government imposed new export restrictions on AI chips to China, affecting the company's H20, L20, and L2 models designed specifically for the Chinese market.

            HBO's Silicon Valley satirized tech culture years before the current AI boom, accurately foreseeing how male-dominated tech companies would shape AI development with inherent biases. The show portrayed tech bros building products that reflected their limited worldviews while claiming to serve humanity's best interests. This paternalistic approach mirrors today's AI landscape where predominantly male teams create systems that make decisions for users while insisting they know what's best for society.<br><br>Source: The Atlantic<br>https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/silicon-valley-tv-show-ai-paternalism/682411/

            The viral trend of creating Studio Ghibli-style images using ChatGPT's DALL-E 3 image generator has sparked debate about AI art ethics. Artists argue that AI systems trained on copyrighted works without permission constitute a form of moral injury, even when the resulting images don't directly infringe copyright law. This controversy highlights the gap between legal and ethical standards in AI development, as companies like OpenAI face pressure to address artists' concerns while maintaining that their training methods are legally protected under fair use doctrine.<br><br>Source: Vox<br>https://www.vox.com/artificial-intelligence/408786/ai-art-studio-ghibli-moral-injury-copyright

            Researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 have developed a novel approach to prevent prompt injection attacks against large language models. The technique, called "prompt sanitization," works by detecting and neutralizing malicious inputs before they reach the AI system, addressing a vulnerability that has plagued generative AI since its widespread adoption. Unlike previous methods that rely on filtering specific phrases, this approach uses a specialized AI model to identify the semantic intent of potentially harmful prompts. The researchers report a ninety-eight percent success rate in blocking attacks during testing across multiple commercial AI systems.<br><br>Source: Ars Technica<br>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/

            The U.S. government has blocked Nvidia from selling certain artificial intelligence chips to China without a license, marking the first major semiconductor export restriction under the Trump administration. Nvidia will take a $5.5 billion charge against revenue in the current quarter due to H20 inventory and purchase commitments it can no longer fulfill. The company had previously created the China-specific H20 chip in response to Biden administration restrictions in 2022, modifying its H100 chip to fall below U.S. government thresholds.

The former New York governor had promised to build and preserve 500,000 housing units to address the city's worst housing crisis in over 50 years. The AI-related mishap provided ammunition to his eight Democratic primary challengers, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who criticized Cuomo for relying on AI rather than developing substantive policy.

            Despite President Trump's executive orders aimed at reviving coal for power generation, energy experts predict these efforts will likely fail. Coal now produces only 17 percent of U.S. electricity, overshadowed by natural gas (38 percent), renewables (25 percent), and nuclear (20 percent). The decline stems primarily from economic factors, as coal cannot compete with cheaper alternatives like natural gas, which became abundant through the fracking boom. Many existing coal plants are aging and would require costly upgrades to remain operational, while some regions like New England plan to eliminate coal power entirely.<br><br>Source: The New York Times<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/energy-environment/trump-coal-power-plants.html

            Microsoft researchers found that longer reasoning chains in large language models don't necessarily indicate higher intelligence and can actually introduce more errors. Their study shows that while step-by-step reasoning helps models solve problems, extending these chains beyond optimal lengths leads to performance degradation. The researchers observed that models tend to introduce errors when forced to generate longer explanations, suggesting that simply scaling up compute and context length may not be the most effective approach to improving AI reasoning capabilities.

            Nvidia recorded a $5.5 billion impairment charge due to US export controls on chip sales to China, with potential total revenue losses exceeding $10 billion. The chipmaker has been restricted from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers since October 2022, forcing it to develop China-specific chips with reduced capabilities. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, up 122 percent year-over-year, driven by surging demand for AI computing hardware worldwide.<br><br>Source: Financial Times https://www.ft.com/content/7935826a-ba3b-4f6b-a64d-b8167d5dc38e

            OpenAI has dramatically reduced the time allocated for safety testing its latest AI models from months to mere days, according to eight people familiar with the company's processes. Testers of the upcoming o3 model report having less than a week for safety evaluations that previously took six months for GPT-4. The accelerated timeline stems from competitive pressures as OpenAI races against Meta, Google, and Elon Musk's xAI to maintain market leadership in the $300 billion AI industry. Critics note that the company has also scaled back on thorough testing methods such as fine-tuning models on specialized datasets to assess potential misuse in areas like biological research.<br><br>Source: Financial Times<br>https://www.ft.com/content/8253b66e-ade7-4d1f-993b-2d0779c7e7d8

            Nvidia developed new methods to address communication bottlenecks in federated learning systems when working with large language models. The techniques include message quantization, which reduces communication overhead by compressing model updates, and streaming, which enables processing of model updates in chunks rather than waiting for complete downloads. These approaches allow organizations to collaboratively train large AI models while keeping sensitive data local and maintaining privacy. Tests show these optimizations can reduce communication overhead by up to 32 times while preserving model accuracy.<br><br>Source: developer.nvidia.com<br>https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/efficient-federated-learning-in-the-era-of-llms-with-message-quantization-and-streaming/

            NVIDIA explains how packet loss in network communications can significantly degrade AI and high-performance computing workloads by increasing latency and disrupting GPU synchronization. When packet loss occurs, it forces retransmissions or stalls in the communication pipeline, directly impacting collective operations like all-reduce or broadcast where every GPU must participate before work can progress. Network convergence and fabric resiliency have become essential considerations for maintaining optimal performance in distributed AI training environments.<br><br>Source: developer.nvidia.com<br>https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/ai-fabric-resiliency-and-why-network-convergence-matters/

            Microsoft's Xbox app is rolling out the ability to purchase games, DLC, and Game Pass subscriptions directly from its mobile application on iOS and Android. The update, currently available to beta testers and coming to all users "soon," represents a significant shift in Xbox's mobile strategy following a court ruling that required Google to open Android to third-party app stores. While users gain purchasing capabilities, Microsoft has removed the remote play feature from the app, though it remains accessible via mobile browsers, Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will also gain the ability to stream select owned games from their consoles without downloading them first.<br><br>Source: The Verge https://www.theverge.com/news/649958/xbox-purchase-games-mobile-app-launch

            Lyft acquired European mobility platform FreeNow for €175 million ($198.40 million) from BMW and Mercedes-Benz, marking its first major expansion beyond North America. The deal nearly doubles Lyft's potential market as it competes with Uber, giving the company access to over 150 European cities including London, Berlin, and Madrid. FreeNow, which will initially retain its branding, primarily aggregates taxis alongside private vehicles with luxury rides making up a significant portion of its fleet. Taxis account for approximately 90 percent of FreeNow's gross bookings in 2024, and the company achieved break-even status in September following a 13 percent year-on-year revenue increase.<br><br>Source: theverge.com https://www.theverge.com/news/649772/lyft-freenow-acquisition-taxi-bmw-mercedes

            Apple has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 60 percent since 2015, putting it more than halfway to its 2030 goal of eliminating 75 percent of emissions. The company has pioneered innovative approaches to address Scope 3 emissions, including purchasing renewable power on behalf of customers who buy Apple Watch Series 9 and M4 Mac mini devices. Apple has also focused on semiconductor manufacturing, with 26 suppliers pledging to abate at least 90 percent of fluorinated greenhouse gases, which can be thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. For the remaining 25 percent of emissions, Apple plans to invest in nature-based carbon removal solutions.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/apple-races-to-surpass-rivals-in-quest-to-eliminate-carbon-pollution/

            Microsoft researchers developed BitNet b1.58 2B4T, the largest-scale 1-bit AI model to date, now available under an MIT license. The "bitnet" uses compressed weights that require only 1 bit of memory instead of the 16 or 32 bits used in standard models, enabling efficient operation on CPUs including Apple's M2. This compression approach significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining reasonable performance, making AI deployment possible on lightweight hardware without specialized accelerators.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/microsoft-researchers-say-theyve-developed-a-hyper-efficient-ai-model-that-can-run-on-cpus/

            An NSO Group lawyer has publicly identified Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan as customers behind the 2019 Pegasus spyware campaign that targeted over 1,200 WhatsApp users. This unprecedented disclosure occurred during a hearing in Meta's lawsuit against the Israeli spyware maker, marking the first time NSO representatives have confirmed specific government clients after years of refusing to discuss their customer base. The campaign exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp between April and May 2019, with many victims identified as human rights activists and journalists. Court documents revealed that targeted individuals were located across 51 countries, though NSO's lawyer suggested the company has "at least eight customers" involved in the discovery process.<br><br>Source: TechCrunch<br>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/nso-lawyer-names-mexico-saudi-arabia-and-uzbekistan-as-spyware-customers-behind-2019-whatsapp-hacks/

            Bill Gates believes artificial intelligence will significantly disrupt white-collar and creative jobs that were previously considered resistant to technological displacement. The Microsoft co-founder expects AI to dramatically transform knowledge work, including roles in law, accounting, and creative fields like writing and graphic design. Gates suggests AI will ultimately create more jobs than it eliminates, but acknowledges the transition will be challenging for many workers. He emphasizes that AI tools will augment human capabilities rather than completely replace workers in most scenarios.<br><br>Source: Business Insider (via Google News) https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNWUN5djIxWVZERlg3S0ZIX1o0RXlWcGhyRU9RZVBUZzVwNmZxUnJTRG1RaWdzeGdVaHRDVWY3TjdWaHY5X3NjTFdCM3hRQk5aU3FzekZMcWdTdUhxek9sOGtHUDlvRDZMd2xJbUZ1RDdiQTBLUWt6NXNXallhc05DeFBLd3FFYXN2WXp4QjNiWjRYTXNrM043QnhaVnRrRW8?oc=5

            The Texas Observer released an article titled "AI Is Dead" that challenges the current narrative around artificial intelligence. The piece examines how AI technologies are often overhyped despite significant limitations in their actual capabilities. It critiques the tendency of tech companies and media to exaggerate AI advancements while downplaying the human labor that powers many so-called AI systems.

            Nvidia failed to notify some Chinese customers about new U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips before they were announced in October, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company informed only select customers in China about the impending rules, which ban sales of its H20 AI chip designed specifically for the Chinese market. This selective disclosure potentially gave some firms an advantage in securing chip supplies before restrictions took effect. The H20 chip, which complies with earlier U.S. export rules but not the newer ones, has been delayed until early 2024.<br><br>Source: Reuters https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNc1loT1A3UmdHbXpQM0U0TU9MZVNUbVo0NW9SSGRrcGpOTEg3MXdROXZXNno3QkVENVdpLWNVSGNtdm1DOURBTEV2ODVRWmJsZEdrY3F3YzlRMVE2VUs3bFg5bi0yczYzaXNVNWQwZ1p1NVhQRjBkVTIxSTdad1VlaUFxQ1VnWEFVZ2t4TzIxX21JT3BlUUExeXVMcWhpWVIzS3dkWmVrMXRHX2c5VEdPVGstY081cHdWMnJNUVNqaEhUQQ?oc=5

The system demonstrates lower power efficiency compared to Nvidia's GB200 NVL72, but this limitation is less significant within China's market context. CloudMatrix 384 represents Huawei's strategic push to develop indigenous AI acceleration capabilities, reducing dependency on U.S. technology amid ongoing trade restrictions. The system architecture reflects China's commitment to building a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem despite performance gaps with leading Western alternatives.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250416/p12#a250416p12

            Chinese investors are increasingly cautious about funding AI startups focused on building foundation models, with venture capital funding for AI and machine learning in China dropping 30 percent year-over-year to 1.2 billion dollars in the first quarter. The investment community now favors practical AI applications that can be built on top of existing foundation models like DeepSeek. This strategic pivot reflects both economic pressures and a recognition that the next wave of AI growth in China will likely come from specialized applications rather than competing directly with established foundation model providers.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com<br>http://www.techmeme.com/250416/p6#a250416p6
