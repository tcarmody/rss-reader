                        President Trump is set to impose a 104% tariff on all Chinese imports, on top of existing tariffs. This move comes after China refused to back down on its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The new tariffs will significantly impact U.S. consumers, leading to higher prices for goods imported from China, including consumer electronics and other products. The tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and result in layoffs. China has vowed to escalate its retaliation on U.S. exports in response.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com

                        Microsoft is canceling its plans to invest $1 billion in three data centers in Ohio, the latest in a series of data center project cancellations by the company. This decision comes as the U.S. government imposes a 104% tariff on Chinese imports, which is expected to significantly impact Apple and its supply chain. The White House has expressed a belief that Apple can move iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., citing the company's $500 billion investment in the country. However, experts argue that an iPhone made in the U.S. is "pure fantasy" due to the lack of skilled labor and advanced tooling required for such production.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com

                        Amid tariff concerns, Nintendo has delayed the start of Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada past the originally scheduled April 9 date. The company cited the need to align the timing of pre-orders with the U.S. market. The June 5, 2025 launch date for the console remains unchanged. Nintendo has also adopted a "variable pricing" model, with some games costing up to $113 CAD.<br><br>Source: techmeme.com

                        Meta released two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverick, claiming Maverick could outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on widely reported benchmarks. However, researchers discovered that the version of Maverick tested on the LMArena benchmark site was an "experimental chat version" specifically optimized for conversationality, not the same as the publicly available model. This raised concerns about gaming the benchmark system, as it makes the rankings less meaningful as indicators of real-world performance. Meta acknowledged the customized model but stated it experiments with various variants. The release of Llama 4 has been generally confusing, with rumors of the model being trained to perform better on benchmarks while hiding limitations. This episode highlights how AI benchmarks are becoming battlegrounds as the technology develops rapidly.<br><br>Source: nytimes.com
