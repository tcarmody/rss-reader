                        The Supreme Court in New Delhi experienced a peculiar incident where the judges mistook a lawyer appearing via video conference for an A.I. system. The judges questioned the lawyer&#39;s existence, highlighting the challenges faced by the legal system in adapting to remote proceedings.

This incident underscores the need for improved video conferencing technology and training for judges to better navigate the evolving landscape of virtual court proceedings. As the A.I. industry continues to advance, such cases serve as a reminder of the importance of clear communication and understanding between legal professionals and emerging technologies.

                        Meta and Anthropic&#39;s use of the &#39;fair use&#39; legal defense against copyright infringement allegations for training AI tools on published books will not be effective in U.K. courts, according to the Publishers Association and Society of Authors.

The article highlights that the &#39;fair use&#39; defense, which has been employed in the U.S., is unlikely to be applicable in the U.K. legal system. This is a key detail for AI developers to consider when training their models on copyrighted materials. The implications of this ruling are significant for the AI industry, as it underscores the need for AI companies to carefully navigate copyright laws, particularly when operating in different jurisdictions.

                        Microsoft has unveiled an AI-powered demo inspired by Quake 2, but the experience falls short, running poorly and causing motion sickness. The demo, powered by Microsoft&#39;s &#34;World and Human Action Model&#34; (WHAM) generative AI, aims to showcase the potential of AI in gaming, but the results are unimpressive. The demo&#39;s development likely required significant investment in compute power, research, and resources, highlighting the challenges of bringing generative AI to interactive experiences.

                        Samsung Electronics is expected to report a 21% decline in its first-quarter profit, hurt by sluggish sales of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and ongoing losses in its contract chip manufacturing business. The world&#39;s largest memory chip maker, currently undergoing a management reshuffle following the sudden death of co-CEO Han Jong-Hee in late March, is set to release its preliminary Q1 earnings on Tuesday. The company has been struggling with declining chip profits since mid-2022 as it fell behind its key rival SK Hynix in supplying high-performance memory chips to AI chip leader Nvidia.

                        Researchers argue that the rules and expectations for AI systems should vary based on the type of relationship they are trying to simulate, such as friend, tutor, doctor, or lover. This is because the appropriate level of intimacy, trust, and boundaries differs for each type of relationship. AI developers should consider these nuanced factors when designing AI systems to ensure they behave ethically and meet user expectations. Properly tailoring the rules for AI systems is crucial for building trust and acceptance within the AI industry.
