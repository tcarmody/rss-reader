Despite over $1 million in lifetime Arduboy sales, the 104% tariff on products from China will make it impossible for Bates to continue operating his business profitably.\n\nBates says that even if he wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S., there are no manufacturers who would be able to produce the Arduboy at a reasonable cost. The global trade that allowed the Arduboy to exist is now being disrupted by the trade war, and Bates is already looking for a new day job.\n\nThis news is significant for AI developers and enthusiasts who have followed the Arduboy's journey. The Arduboy was a unique product that allowed individuals to create and distribute their own games and applications, and its demise is a cautionary tale about the impact of trade policies on small businesses and innovative products.",

The unconventional and decentralized design of Git, which was revolutionary at the time, has since become ubiquitous and seemingly obvious. Torvalds emphasized that his primary goal was to create a tool that worked well for him, rather than worrying about broader appeal.\n\nThe interview covers Torvalds' thought process in designing Git's core concepts, such as the use of SHA-1 hashes for stability and the distributed nature that has enabled services like GitHub to thrive. While Torvalds had a clear vision from the start, he was not certain the project would be as successful as it has become over the past 20 years.\n\nTorvalds also discussed his decision to hand off maintainership of Git to Junio Hamano early on, and how he has largely stepped back from active involvement in the project since then, as it has evolved to meet the needs of a much broader community of users. He noted that while he is not closely following the latest developments, he is generally satisfied with the direction the project has taken.\n\nOverall, the interview provides insights into the origins and design philosophy of one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, from the perspective of its creator.",

Colossal's chief scientific officer, Beth Shapiro, acknowledges the philosophical debate around the classification of the animals, but maintains that they are not gray wolves.\n\nThe creation of these \"dire wolves\" demonstrates the advancing capabilities of science in manipulating animal genomes. While the project does not have an obvious conservation purpose, it has generated significant attention and interest, leading Colossal to explore commercial opportunities, such as a docuseries about the company's exploits.\n\nThe article highlights the challenges and controversies surrounding de-extinction efforts, as well as the potential for such technologies to be used for conservation purposes in the future.",

    "summary": "The booming investment in artificial intelligence is overwhelming suppliers of giant metal turbines used to turn natural gas into electricity, leading to longer wait times and higher costs for building new gas power plants.\n\nCompanies that haven't already reserved this specialized equipment, which can weigh as much as a large airplane and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are facing waits of three to four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier. The cost of building gas power plants has also soared, with some estimates showing it now costs two to three times as much as it did a few years ago.\n\nThis challenge in securing enough gas turbines is a clear example of how the rising demand for AI, driven by the need for data centers to train and use chatbots and other AI applications, is reshaping the electric power industry. It also serves as a reminder of the gap between the plans and goals of politicians, energy executives, and the reality on the ground.",
