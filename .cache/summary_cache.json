OpenAI's 40 billion dollar round accounted for 44 percent of this total, with nine other companies raising 500 million dollars or more making up an additional 27 percent of funding. PitchBook analyst Kyle Stanford warns that market volatility and recession fears triggered by tariff policies have derailed expectations for 2025 exits, forcing many startups to postpone IPOs and potentially face down rounds or discounted acquisitions.

Rather than implementing broad tariffs, the administration should use the current 90-day pause to develop a focused industrial strategy that aligns trade policy with America's strengths in energy innovation. While the US has become the world's largest producer of oil and gas, true energy dominance requires evolving beyond raw commodity exports to become a manufacturing hub for sophisticated energy technologies.

    "summary": "Google has made Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite generally available in the Gemini API for production use in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. The model offers improved performance over 1.5 Flash across reasoning, multimodal, math and factuality benchmarks while providing a more cost-effective solution for projects requiring long context windows. Developers are already leveraging the 2.0 Flash family for applications including Daily's voice AI experiences, Dawn's semantic monitoring for AI products, and Mosaic's video editing tools. The simplified pricing of $0.10 per 1 million input tokens makes the 1 million token context window 33 percent more affordable than previous offerings.\n\nSource: deepmind.google\nhttps://deepmind.google/discover/blog/start-building-with-gemini-20-flash-and-flash-lite/",
