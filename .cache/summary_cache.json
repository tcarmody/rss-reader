Cappy functions as a scorer that evaluates the correctness of responses to instructions, either working independently on classification tasks or as an auxiliary component to boost LLM performance. Unlike parameter-efficient tuning strategies that still require back-propagation through LLM parameters, Cappy enables downstream supervision without finetuning, reducing memory requirements and working with closed-source models.

    "summary": "Benchmark Capital's Sarah Tavel identified finance and customer service as the two sectors most vulnerable to AI job displacement. Finance professionals face disruption as AI systems can now analyze financial data and make investment decisions with increasing sophistication. Customer service roles are being automated through AI chatbots and virtual assistants that can handle inquiries around the clock. Tavel noted that while AI eliminates certain positions, it also creates new opportunities requiring different skill sets, suggesting workers should focus on developing capabilities that complement rather than compete with AI.\n\nSource: news.google.com https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOX0xYRHY2UTNhZWNId3hNaFBHRVZuRGRNMnFfTHk2ZlhYN2t2UUJvMHBaajNBRkNqcFJSYkpGOWExMTVBdXdtTm5wbzZqUDFUNFQwbmNXWXl1ZkNqRTBZaXhoSl81LXZFdjJkbENzR2ZWcEpuSUs0T3J5c1hmY3ByaW1kRGZxbk5rWUhmOEdINWlleXdNdDBOZXlhSnZVOXFxUzVpYTdzTnZDbEph?oc=5",
