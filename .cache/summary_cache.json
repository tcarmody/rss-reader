      "headline": "OpenAI faces growing opposition to nonprofit-to-profit transition plan",
      "summary": "A diverse coalition including consumer advocates, labor groups, law professors, and Elon Musk is challenging OpenAI's plan to shed its nonprofit status. Legal scholars and former employees have asked attorneys general in California and Delaware to block the restructuring, arguing it would remove powerful AI technology from oversight meant to benefit humanity rather than chase profits. California's attorney general must approve any conversion of a nonprofit with significant assets to a for-profit entity. OpenAI maintains the restructuring would strengthen its nonprofit mission while securing necessary investment to compete with rivals like Google and Meta, who are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure.\n\nSource: The Washington Post\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/24/trump-trump-memecoin-cryto/"

      "headline": "Thrifting apps see surge in downloads as tariffs on Chinese goods drive shoppers to secondhand market",
      "summary": "Americans are increasingly turning to resale platforms like Poshmark, Depop, and eBay as tariffs on Chinese imports threaten to raise prices on new goods. Downloads of thrifting and resale apps jumped 18 percent in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter, with Depop seeing a 68 percent increase. The secondhand market benefits from having inventory already in the U.S., insulating it from tariff impacts that affect overseas retailers. Industry experts suggest this economic pressure could drive more significant consumer behavior changes than previous economic disruptions like the pandemic or inflation.\n\nSource: Washington Post\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/24/intel-cuts-manufacturing-trump/"
