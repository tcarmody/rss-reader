      "summary": "A diverse coalition including consumer advocates, labor groups, law professors, and Elon Musk is challenging OpenAI's plan to shed its nonprofit status. Legal scholars and former employees have asked attorneys general in California and Delaware to block the restructuring, arguing it would remove powerful AI technology from oversight meant to benefit humanity rather than chase profits. California's attorney general must approve any conversion of a nonprofit with significant assets to a for-profit entity. OpenAI maintains the restructuring would strengthen its nonprofit mission while securing necessary investment to compete with rivals like Google and Meta, who are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure.\n\nSource: The Washington Post\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/24/trump-trump-memecoin-cryto/"
