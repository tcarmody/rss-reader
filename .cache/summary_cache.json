In a recent interview, Torvalds discussed the early days of Git, the key design decisions behind its success, and how it has forever changed software development.\n\nTorvalds initially developed Git in just 10 days to meet his own needs for the Linux kernel project. The unconventional and decentralized design of Git, which was revolutionary at the time, has since become ubiquitous and seemingly obvious. Torvalds emphasized that his primary goal was to create a tool that worked well for him, rather than worrying about broader appeal.\n\nThe interview covers Torvalds' thought process in designing Git's core concepts, such as the use of SHA-1 hashes for stability and the distributed nature that has enabled services like GitHub to thrive. While Torvalds had a clear vision from the start, he was not certain the project would be as successful as it has become over the past 20 years.\n\nTorvalds also discussed his decision to hand off maintainership of Git to Junio Hamano early on, and how he has largely stepped back from active involvement in the project since then, as it has evolved to meet the needs of a much broader community of users. He noted that while he is not closely following the latest developments, he is generally satisfied with the direction the project has taken.\n\nOverall, the interview provides insights into the origins and design philosophy of one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, from the perspective of its creator.",

The order will direct the federal government to list coal as a critical mineral and force some coal-fired power plants that had faced closure to keep generating electricity. While the executive order might forestall some closures, it's unlikely to reverse coal's persistent decline in the power sector.\n\nCoal's share of electricity generation has declined steadily since 2001, and today it accounts for only about 15% of the country's electricity. Clean air regulations and the rise of low-cost natural gas and renewable energy sources have been the primary drivers of coal's decline. The Trump administration's efforts to prop up the coal industry are unlikely to have a significant impact on the power sector's shift away from coal.",

The company, which has attracted funding from Bezos' family office and other wealthy investors, is aiming to produce an affordable two-seat electric pickup truck for around $25,000. Slate plans to supplement the small margins of its low-cost truck by building out a line of accessories and apparel that owners can use to customize their vehicles. The startup has amassed a sizable war chest, raising at least $111 million in a Series A round in 2023 and an additional Series B round late last year. Slate hopes to get its vehicle into production as soon as late 2026 at a manufacturing facility near Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nSource: techcrunch.com",

Even coal industry executives recognize that regulatory rollbacks cannot reverse the sector's declining trajectory.\n\nSource: Wired\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-wants-to-save-the-coal-industry-hes-too-late/",

The facility will feature four Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactors that use helium-cooled fuel pebbles capable of reaching 1,000\u00b0C, providing both steam and electricity to replace aging natural gas infrastructure. The project, partially funded through the Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, could establish a model for industrial decarbonization that data centers and other power-intensive facilities might follow. Operations are expected to begin early next decade, following a regulatory review process that could take up to two and a half years.\n\nSource: MIT Technology Review\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/09/1114589/chemical-plant-nuclear/",

The AI tools are reportedly scanning employee communications and social media for criticism of the incoming administration, with particular focus on the Department of Veterans Affairs. This surveillance effort represents a significant expansion of DOGE's activities beyond its stated efficiency mandate and raises serious privacy and civil liberties concerns for government employees. The monitoring appears to be part of a broader effort to identify and potentially remove federal workers perceived as disloyal to the Trump administration.\n\nSource: news.google.com https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQWVJ2eXpwOHlEMi1FTUl6eTFvOV95dW5idjEwUEVnVEJuc0paalp0LXNqRDVpamQ3ZFZNeE9qZlpMejQ3TlRaN2owcVNodjA2YnQ2bnZXeWdNV04wX24tR3VQYWVqc0hZUWtZQ1dsTnkzSS1mNkNzWXF4SzNwM2RfMnNLMm5mcGZhaWM4VG1qSUxxc3ZUaEY3TlRvVHR1cDkwaUlsWHpIZFAtV0VGcHg0MzUta2ZJb0hFaV",

    "summary": "Google unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Cloud Next conference, marking the first TPU specifically designed for inference rather than training. The new AI accelerator chip will be available in late 2025 in two configurations: a 256-chip cluster or a massive 9,216-chip cluster. Ironwood represents Google's continued investment in custom silicon to power AI workloads as competition intensifies among cloud providers developing specialized hardware for machine learning operations.\n\nSource: TechCrunch\nhttp://www.techmeme.com/250409/p22#a250409p22",
