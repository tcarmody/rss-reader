Legal scholars and former employees have asked attorneys general in California and Delaware to block the restructuring, arguing it would remove powerful AI technology from oversight meant to benefit humanity rather than chase profits. California's attorney general must approve any conversion of a nonprofit with significant assets to a for-profit entity. OpenAI maintains the restructuring would strengthen its nonprofit mission while securing necessary investment to compete with rivals like Google and Meta, who are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure.\n\nSource: The Washington Post\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/24/trump-trump-memecoin-cryto/"

While the algorithm successfully reduced bureaucracy for straightforward cases, it has incorrectly rejected hundreds of vulnerable Brazilians due to minor errors or when handling complex situations. The system's rigid automated decision-making process has created new barriers for citizens most in need of assistance, forcing many to navigate additional appeals processes. The algorithmic failures highlight the risks of deploying AI in critical social welfare systems without adequate human oversight or appeal mechanisms.\n\nSource: Rest of World\nhttp://www.techmeme.com/250425/p7#a250425p7"
